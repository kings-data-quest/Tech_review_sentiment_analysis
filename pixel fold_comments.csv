"I learned a few more bits and pieces about the Pixel Fold while roaming Google I/O! They're threaded here:

https://twitter.com/Captain2Phones/status/1656532458228318209?t=BgDltFpknR50srwmdPrYRg&s=19"
"Really excited about this one - but I think it needs 2nd gen with thinner bezels, less pronounced crease & tensor G3 to warrant a $1799 price tag. Excellent video as always!"
Respect to Google for letting the folding tech connoisseur take a look at this.
Went from fold 3 to fold 4. Had my eyes on the 5 but I'm glad google threw their hat in the ring to offer some viable competition to the foldable king. Can't wait for the full review.
"Using the terms ""Dorsal and Ventral, Port and Starboard"" to describe the bezel sides that were fattened, is exactly the reason that I'll watch your reviews regardless of what's being reviewed. It's just great writing with character and class!"
"Much like the early smartphones of the mid 2000s, each new iteration brought so many improvements it was hard to justify buying last years model, even if it meant you could save a ton of money. Nowadays though, you could buy a 3 year old phone and probably not notice too much different compared to the brand new, full priced phone. I feel like foldables will get to that same point in the next ~5 years or so, and that's probably when I can justify buying one. For now, I live vicariously through people that can afford them."
Exiting times ahead for the foldable side of things. Great storytelling as always. I still seem to be tilting on the side of Galaxy Fold 5 when it’s out.
Really interesting to see how the screen stands up to 12 months of use and how the warranty will support wear and tear of the hinges and on/off button and screen quality. Very interesting mix of subjects. A comparison between Galaxy and Google is exciting.
I'm psyched about the aspect ratios for the pixel fold. That and the more gentle folding angle are the 2 biggest selling points for this one IMO.  Might be the first phone to tempt me into a foldable.  Just gotta check a lot of couch cushions to scrounge up the cash...
"Have been following his journey from pocket now to this channel. And it amazes me how well mrmobile has been able to differentiate from rest of the tech channels. Also, I don't think the bezels are much, they hide the camera and if you're lying down on the bed, they give you space to hold the phone and control phantom touches. Again, just my opinion."
"Thanks so much for bringing us with you to check out the Pixel Fold! I'm looking forward to the software optimizations this device will bring to the entire Android foldable space (hopefully). The Fold & Pixel Tablet are the two things I'm most interested in at this year's I/O; hopefully you get a look at the tablet as well. Your reviews are very straightforward, with clearly stated pros & cons of the devices that you review, and I very much appreciate that aspect of your content."
"Hope to see Google announce something like the S-Pen for this, because that's a big reason I want to upgrade to a Fold 5 when it comes out. The use my Note 20 Ultra gets as a productivity, notetaking and edoc signing monster is just as valuable to me as it's cameras, when despite how much flexibility you have with the fold with its ""built in tripod"", still have me contemplating going for the S23 Ultra or even waiting for the 24 Ultra."
"Your review videos of foldable phones are fantastic. Every time I watch any foldable review, I feel mesmerized. The phone specifications are covered in great detail. The reviews are finely edited. I wish I had those wonderful phones. Please keep on making great review videos."
"More foldables is always good, but those cameras better be really good to justify this over a Samsung fold. I don't see any other killer feature"
Sir I had a fold 1 and currently a fold 3. Thank you so much for your constant fold coverage. You are a big reason I got into foldables
"So excited you're covering this, first foldable I've considered since hearing about it. Very excited for your coming reviews of it."
Definitely very interesting addition to the foldable market and I think you'll be right on your thoughts about android being more optimised for foldables
"LOVE how you banged out this video while Google IO was still going on. I would say it definitely looks impressive. As a person who has a Fold 3 and only rocks a Google Pixel 6 Pro because I LOVE the Google UI, Haptic feedback as well as the camera, I may have to scoop this up. I also LIKE the shorter/wider form factor compared to the longer/narrower one of the Fold series. Honestly it's either this or the OPPO Find N2(which I can get for cheaper here). Thanks again for this LOVELY video and we all look forward to the real review."
It's so exciting to have your commentary on this. You did a great job at capturing the genuine excitement this phone brings to the market!
"As someone who is currently watching this on the z fold 3, I am going to have to see a full review and get a hands on at my verizon store before I consider leaving the galaxy line.  It looks incredibly promising.  But right now Samsung has such a far ahead lead on the rest of the folding market, it's hard to beat"
I think it'll be good for the foldable segment now that google will tailor software updates for the format. Not enough to tempt me from my z fold 4 but im definitely curious about using a phone with that aspect ratio of the outer display. I regularly feel constricted by the narrow outer display and thats it being a good upgrade from my old fold 2. Hopefully they go wider again with the 5.
Impressive job on the video while on the road! Love to hear that it does indeed feel like a duo. Would've loved to see them side by side but i guess there's only so many phones you can bring  please ask them whether they are considering a multitasking -first mode like duo!
Excellent coverage
"I always come back to Micheal a couple a times every year for his Pixel videos. His style of filming, and dialogue is always so on point and friendly."
"I'm tempted, but I am still smitten with my Z Fold 3, so I think I will hold out for the Fold 5 this summer. I'm sticking with the Samsung Folds, because I have chucked my Fold 3 around (by accident) and used it for work in some very dirty and wet project sites, and it still works perfectly and is an excellent size. I am curious as to how Google's screen will fare compared to Samsung's earlier models or if these will be just as sturdy as Samsung's current offerings? I am just happy to see that we are getting more options in the US market, because I could never go back to a standard brick phone."
I can't wait to see your full review on this device! This is the first folder I've seen that has really intrigued me. I hope they don't skimp out on internal storage and battery size!
Excited to see this finally release. I've tried a couple foldables before but I'm excited to see how the PFold's software sends waves throughout Android's foldable software in general. Might also help the rare Android tablet owner as well..
I'm not moving from my duo until atleast 2024/25 but glad to see Google doing this and in a way looks for me very positive for the duo 3. That said like the look of this.
A bit disappointed that there wasn’t anything about a Dex equivalent or stylus support. I was hoping something like chromebook functionality would be available when plugged into an external display. I use a Samsung phone with an ipad mini where I connect my phone to a bigger display for Dex and then use my iPad for note taking with the apple pencil. It would be awesome if those two were combined. Now to wait for the Fold 5s offering.
I love how the Pixel Fold still has a physical SIM tray!
That disclaimer at the end is what makes your word and content so trustworthy. I admire your honesty and as well the quality of your videos. Thank you Michael.
"That Pixel Fold looks super tempting as I’ve been thinking about considering an upgrade from my Z Flip3 to a book-style foldable. I just wish that Pixel devices were more available globally because, although I haven’t checked in a while, I believe Pixel is not officially sold here in NZ and, if I want one, Might have to get out my Passport and fly to Australia to buy one. Or somehow import it from somewhere."
"The form factor of this one is perfect. Absolutely adore it. I guess I'm starting to save now.

Every artist, graphic designer and meme maker I know is drooling over this phone. This might finally knock the ""couple of years old galaxy note"" from it's spot as the phone of choice for android based artists."
"NICE! I hope the guys at Google appreciated the fact you sported the Levi's Google Jacquard jacket! Interesting device. I went from Fold 1 to Surface Duo to Fold 2 and  back to Surface Duo (when they finally fixed the firmware), with a couple of Flips mixed in ... I prefer the size and aspect of the Duo to the Samsung Fold, and this Pixel Fold seems to be the right candidate for my next phone!"
This is HUGE for the foldable space! I’m excited to see what comes from here!
"I'm gun shy about switching to another brand after leaving Apple for Samsungs Fold 3...but the rave reviews of the Google pixel 7 and 7 pro have me curious and interested...and now the pixel fold has me that much more so...I guess I'll wait for your full review cause you, flossy, and Mr. Boss are the 3 people I listen to when it comes  to mobile phones.... Thank You for such great content and the effort you put into the production of it..."
"Really great news for the foldable fans. Not only will some competition help push things forward, but the added software support from Google throwing their hat in the ring will be huge.

Also, I like the bezels. I'd rather have thicker bezels again to hold cameras. I've never been a fan of the hole punch approach. It's usually something I can get used to, but I still find it's occasionally in the way."
I'm very happy that you were able to cover this at the same time as everyone else so we could get your first impressions at the same time.  Thanks for the video and I look forward to the full review!
"I both did and didn't expect this! The smaller form factor looks easier to hold, not too big or too small, just right. You don't need massive displays to see apps."
I love the look of the pixel. I have the fold 4 currently and have been tempted to do a trade in for the pixel - but this is googles first folding phone. Ill probably wait until Im due for an upgrade and get the 2 or 3
"Im stoked to see another foldable, but I think I prefer the inside aspect ratio of the Samsung Fold"
I'm excited for the future of folds. I can't believe my z fold 3 is holding stronger than ever. It's going to be real difficult to go back to the slabs.
This is the first foldable that I've really loved the look of. I really like my Pixel 6 and having a foldable Pixel that's still just as modding friendly would be a dream. But at that price I'd need to wait like 3 generations at least hahaha
"Excellent video Michael. I think the best thing that will come out of this is, that hopefully the android software ecosystem will much faster adapt to the foldable form factor. I hope Google is into this for the long haul. Even though the Pixel Fold didn't look as square as I was afraid it would, I still enjoy the one-hand friendly Galaxy Fold 4. This is overall looking good for a first-gen product, think of how far we've come compared to the first Galaxy Fold. The future is here, and it's foldable!"
"DBrand's integrated kickstand is definitely appealing, (and really should be a first party option).  Otherwise the $1,700 is far too high.  But Google did beat Apple to offering a foldable.  I guess now that there are actually 2 options in the US will prices finally begin to come down (so 2024 maybe?  Sigh)"
"NGL, the pixel fold might be what finally pushes me to a postpaid line with my carrier. I've been on the same grandfathered prepaid line with my carrier since 2016 but i would need to switch to a postpaid with a trade-in to afford a pixel fold, and honestly I think that'd be worth it. The only reason I don't have a pixel rn is that my find N folds, and a pixel doesn't. The pixel android experience has always been my favourite and while I like swapping my sim into different devices... It's my favourite software with hardware that mirrors my current favourite hardware........"
"Oh, have i been waiting for this. Rocking a galaxy fold 3 right now, probably gonna hold on to it for a year or 2 more, but i really want some competition in this space. Im going to want some options when i upgrade later and this seems like a good start!"
"Great video Michael! I'm so glad to hear you're initial assessment of the pixel fold. I'll be very excited to hear your full length review of it, and if you think it, it is price matched very well. Have fun!"
This might be my first foldable. Waiting for a good trade price for 7 pro.
"As a disappointed Duo owner who moved on (but still uses that phone as an e-reader) I really like what I'm seeing here. One question I have is does it have dual SIM/esim support (a feature I've come to love on my Sony Xperia 3 mk III)?
Update: I checked the spec page (duh) and it does have dual sim support (1 nano sim and 1 esim)."
Appreciate the quick coverage and your commitment to your job as a tech communicator. The message you presented may be obvious to those following your channel / the industry in general but it's still well worth saying and spreading to many that have forgotten or remain unaware.
I’m really excited for the new razr and galaxy flip. here’s hoping they love up to even half our expectations
I'm more interested to see how this causes waves in the foldable space now that google has it's own foldable.  Some of the software enhancements won't make it to my Fold 4 (or potentially Fold 5 depending on carrier trade-in/subsidies) but you're right when you say that it means foldables are here and not just a gimmick.
"Hello Mister Mobile, thanks a lot for your first Hands-On, as usual top! My thoughts about the hype: The last weeks and specially days we were attacked by leaks and stories and real videos about the Pixel Fold. And always there is a comparison with the Z Fold 4. Since yesterday we know that it's here. And it is a great device, no doubt about. Formfactor great, outer- and inner 120Hz display great, the bezels I don't care, the camera setup great, software-hardware work together. So, it must be the best foldable ever you can buy in a few weeks in the US and Europe? And the price? Starts at USD 1'799.00 So, is the Pixel Fold really that great device and worth the price? I am a Swiss-Z Fold 4-User since last autumn. And for me this 4th generation is GREAT! Yes, it is bigger, yes there is a hinge, yes, the camera setup could be better, yes, the outer display is not that wide and yes, sometimes I see the crease in the middle (by the way the Pixel Fold also has a minimal, visible crease. For me the Z Fold camera is perfect. Maybe we see the S23 Ultra setup in the Z Fold 5 or something better. But it is still a Smartphone you buy and not a Leica with phone function. All the rest like software, hardware and Display is great too. I didn't have any problems with my Z Fold 4 till now.  I am wondering that only few Youtuber talked about the S-Pen which is not present for the Pixel Fold. Yes, there is no Slot in the Z Fold 4. But it is a real Pen (my hands are big) you can write with and, with all my respect, not a toothpick (Samsung Galaxy Note & Ultra) and with the Samsung standing cover you can even better hold in your hand the Z Fold when it's open. And what about the support? Maybe in the US it works well but here in Europe? If something is wrong with my Z Fold, I go to Zurich in the Samsung Repair Center and 1h later I can pick up again the device (fixed or I got a replacement device)! Do we have the same support with Google Devices in this part of the world? I don’t know and I am not that sure. And to come to an end you can buy now in Switzerland a new Z Fold 4 512GB for SFr. 1'299.00 or SFr. 1'199.00 with 256GB. Which is US Dollar 300 to 400 less than a Pixel Fold. So maybe it is like with the Samsung Foldables. We also must wait the 4th version to be satisfied? But are we ever satisfied? In any case, it stimulates the competition"
"Googles call screening and voice to text in real time on voicemail is so good. The little UI elements and software quirks are what keep me going back to pixel after I originally got the 6 (which was awful btw, many apps were bugged and I had a lot of frustrations) but the little things made me try the 7 and I've loved it. It's gorgeous, it's sturdy, and it does so many little things better than it's contemporaries that I'll probably also check the 8 out. I just wish I could make use of the camera a better without needing to be a shutter nerd because my wife's s22 ultra has a better camera out of the box without tweaking than I feel my pixel 7 does"
"Having a fold 3 and 4 (replaced the 3 with a 4 because of course....seam bubbles )...I super miss NOT having a fold. Its just so.... extra and not in a good way. They were so expensive and Im willing to bet almost no one would use its full potential (the ""extra"" part). I fully suggest anyone wanting a fold to really sit down and think before paying that extra money. Especially with inflation being what it is."
"I absolutely love my fold 4, best phone i have every used. However i hate how narrow the phone is when it is shut, i feel like if it was as wide as a normal phone then it would be amazing. Opening it would be really cool too because you could probably fit more screen inside"
Foldables aren't for me quite yet there are too many tradeoffs I'd be making from my S23 Ultra. However the Pixel Fold is the first foldable that's made me actually consider getting it. I definitely think it has the best hardware of any foldable on the market right now.
"It’s gonna be a long time till I need a new phone, but this one checks almost every single box I have for a phone. Pretty exciting! Though repairability and durability are major to me. I know we likely won’t see any good cases for this phone so hopefully when something goes wrong this phone will have some good options for getting it back to normal"
Am with Fold 3 and love the aspect ratio of Pixel Fold. Only things that holds me back is Tensor G2 (Battery life is not great on my Pixel 7 pro with 5000 mAh) and Software (One UI software is more mature in handling a foldable like having shortcuts for split screen apps and edge panel is just awesome).
"Good to see an alternative for Samsung for the Western markets (thoguh it still won't come to my country but at least proper network support is there) and I'm optimistic that a Google foldable will help create better app support for these rectangular inner screens and tablets. But I still wouldn't get this phone, look great folded but the inner screen is such an eyesore. Not up to the standards for 1800 dollars it would bother me even at half price. I just hope Samsung will make real improvements this year."
"YESSSSSSSS THE FOLDABLE KING IS SHOWING IT OFF!!!!

Edit: because a lot of people seem to be getting confused, I'm calling Mr Mobile the foldable king, not the pixel fold"
"Excited to see your full review on this, you are really looking at it from the best angle, as a fold phone power user.
Thanks for your early impressions."
"Michael, a small correction for you regarding puxel-exclusive features. Call screening is available on some Motorola and Sony phones now. I've had it prompt me a couple times on my Xperia 1III (I don't get many  calls)"
"It does look very nice. Now we have to wait for Z Fold 5, OnePlus V Fold and surface Duo 3 in USA"
Still using the fold 3. As tempting as this is for me to buy I think it's way overpriced for what it is. Especially that processor. Thanks for the video Michael.
"Great review with good points (as usual).
Google absolutely nailed the aspect ratio for the screens (Z Fold's are useless). However, for that price I could (and did) get a S23 AND Tab S8+ (12.4"" display), linked for simultaneous use."
"That IPx8 rating is phenomenal for a foldable. That's pretty damn impressive.   
The hinges and thunk were immediately familiar as a Surface Duo user, and I really think that's a good comparison.   I'm pretty excited about it."
"Eagerly waiting for your long term review. And i hope people understand the importance of Google tapping this form factor rather than wasting time discussing bezels and other less important things. Also really looking forward to other app devs to optimise their apps for bigger android devices. 
( twitter is full of these kind of idiots )"
I have an itch to return to android for abit but if i do i decided il be buying a foldable. So far the huawei mate x3 and the pixel fold have really piqued my interest especially because of their thinness when folded. Am hoping for a huawei Xs3 hopefully i loved the outward screen folding design
Oh man as a fold user I am so excited for this it looks great imo and all probably pick one up!
"Thank you so much for your foldable videos! I begrudgingly upgraded to a pixel 7 after my 4a finall bit it, and your videos about the Find N2 and now the Fold have been super helpful. I'm looking forward to the Fold review! I very nearly bit on the find N2 but nixed it when I watched your video about the app weirdness and lack of android auto support (dirving in LA I use android auto every day)."
Looking forward to seeing this in action in India
Just watched Google I/O but I always wait to see the @MrMobile review first over everyone else's. 10 Min of my time to you Michel Fisher. Bravo!
I like how your camerawork quality didn't drop even through you were constrained with where you could go with your device. Good stuff
I would love to see Pixel eventually support USI stylus. USBC video output would also be amazing with some kind of desktop mode.... Those are two other features that could eventually become stables of Android or the very least staples of other pixel devices in time.
The only foldable review I was looking forward to today. Happy to see it on day 1!
"That smile on your face as the phone was handed to you said it all.
No more ""jaded tech journo"" here.
Definitely doing much of it's own thing and planting a flag for what Google's vision for a foldable is.
I'm still not sure about the effect of creases on longevity - I have a materials engineering background and repeated folding always worries me."
"I think it's a great start, but the Oppo Find N2 perfects the screen better. Think the pixel fold 2 when it implements those lessons will be useful"
All I want is the next Galaxy Fold to have the S23 Ultra Camera and the hinge from Oppo.
"When I first saw the Pixel Fold it looked kinda familiar, then when you mentioned the Microsoft Surface Duo, it clicked!

 I know that this isn’t the perfect foldable phone that people have been waiting for, but I think it’s close to perfect for now."
Would love to see a comparison between the folds for watching video content.
In MKBHDs video he mentioned most of the hinge mechanism is in the top and bottom of the hinge so it explains the bezels. The design is nice though but the price not so much. I'm hoping its successful though!
"So excited this device is fnally real. Just to build competition and make Samsung try to be a little more then an iterative change the last couple years.

Is there any type of pin support on the inner display?"
I would love to see a clamshell foldable from Google!  That would severely tempt me away from the Z Flip.
I'm so glad Foldables aren't just a fad like tablets were. I really hope this grows into its own product category like Wearables.
"I think the reason why this phone is important is because it’ll be a massive push for app developers to actually take advantage of the capabilities and canvas of foldables, the same way they do with those of the iPad. I’ve always wanted a foldable, but I can’t justify one without the apps to back up the price tag. Love the design though, this phone is a looker!"
"Thanks a lot for a great first presentation of this foldable phone! I have a very special (perhaps) question about a very specific way of using this phone primarily (not exclusively): A tablet mode with a (screen, of course) keyboard on a table or on the lap and a screen in a ""regular"" laptop position. Can you please check out how writing text (a story or notes) in this way is a good way to use this phone (in the same way as an old Nokia Communicator, for instance)? Please check this out both hardwarewise and softwarewise."
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus, Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold 3 and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
This was the video I  was waiting for ever since the leak! Thank you for your service Mr Mobile
"I'm most interested in the battery specs--since it is so thin, how long does it last driving essentially 3 screens?   Great video!"
The first one for my favourite Storyteller YouTuber… Cheers ..I m actually more keen on seeing whether it’s worth spending 1800 USD on this or the one that SONY launches tomorrow.. let us know what you think of the crease.. the ageing and the true benefits of possessing a Google fold when you have Pixel 7A and Pixel 8 in line.
"If they get the price right i might spring for an early upgrade to my pixel 6. 

Also i hope they get a lot of the software issues sorted with ""tablet"" apps on Android"
The first place I come to Foldable reviews is Michael Fisher. It helps so much that he's such a an advocate for this form factor
Really really tempted to switch back to android with pixel 6a/7a. The fold looks great but too expensive for me
"I absolutely loved my Surface Duo, I even had the Gen 1 Damascus skin on it. I Got rid of it because it was too glitchy. I'm saddened that I was impatient and bought a Fold 4 and am stuck making payments on it."
Its a little rough around the edges but this great first attempt. The next one will be pretty good
"It's so refreshing to see an unbiased review of the new foldable, speacially when it's just a hand-on.
Most reviewers would be just happy to be invited and would praise the device no matter what."
Form factor so much better than fold 4. I had the china version of Oppo Fold n2 but struggled with software. Looking forward to this.
Had the Fold 3 had bad battery life and was disappointed with the camera.  I am looking forward to the reviews on this much needed foldable.
"The ViVo X Fold Design and features is what the standard should be like . the MATE X goes a bit forward with being slim . What i want in an Foldable is the main large screen that functions like a regular large phone , without opening and the plus feature would be when opened with proper apps i can use it as a large tablet form of a two screen function to feel independent of each other like what the Lgv60 Dual screen did ."
Came straight here to watch this and give you props for being THE AUTHORITY on foldables!!
Looks like a really nice phone! My dream is that this fancy new software and better support from third party apps can find their way into a device that has same dimensions as Oppo Find N that can be purchased in Europe
"Ah yes, I love thick bezels in 2023. Despite that, I'm glad Samsung is finally getting some real competitions in the foldable space. This will push them and everyone else to make better products"
"Oh man! I really want that phone but it's too expensive for me even with a payment plan! It's exactly what I am looking for in a foldable, including not having a selfie camera on the inside that is a hole punch or under the display, messing up how things look while using it or making the screen fuzzy when it's hidden."
"Since I only recently got my 7 Pro, I'm gonna give the line some more time to develop and hopefully get my hands on a Pixel Fold 4  in a few years time. :)"
I'll upgrade my zf3 to the zf5 this bezel is not my thing being used to small bezels on the zf3. Also prefer the inner screen on the samsung fold taller instead of wide
"The Fold seems to be exactly what I wanted, but I didn't see anything about about screen warranty/replacement cost..."
Wonder how this is going to stack up against the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 being released soon
Those bezels look straight out of 2016
"DUUUUDES this is gnarly AF. Prolly gonna be my first foldable once my Pixel 6A and Galaxy Tab A 2019 finally sh!t the bed (THIS THING WONT DIE!!!)  Was hoping for a Razr-like foldable from the great Googly-moogly, but I'll take it!"
I like it but wish the bezels were smaller and the wired charging was faster.
"If I didn't have the pixel 7 pro, I would be all over this. I'm waiting either for the Pixel 8 pro and or pixel fold 2. I want the tensor G3 on my next pixel"
"Let the future folding phones feast in this fan favorite! 

I'm still going to wait until the second gen comes out!
Watching on my z flip 3!"
Love to see the 5x cam on there! Hopefully Samsung follows suit.
Was refreshing like mad for this video
This is the only foldable I’ve been kinda excited for. I haven’t fully jumped on the foldable hype train yet
@MrMobile what was it like to use the keyboard on the pixel fold? Did you find the outer screen more or less usable that the z fold 4?
Finally some good competition. We might start seeing prices lowering a bit!
"Is Google about to pry me away from the iPhone? Because this looks incredible and I like how it looks way more than the Z-Fold. Especially when it have a similar profile to Oppo’s Find N, but the design language of the Pixel. I’d like to hear about repair options and maybe I’ll wait till a 2nd generation but… wow… I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t tempting"
"Interesting, can't wait to see the pixel flip"
Sweet looking device.  Hoping it takes off.  I've been looking for devices to trade in to take the sting out of that 1800 sticker price.
"Love the form factor of the Pixel Fold. The shorter but wider outer screen seems more comfortable than Samsung's solution. I don't mind the bezels of the inner screen too, which are still thin enough for a modern tablet. I think that's the second best solution after the  corner hole punch."
"A small correction Michael, the wired charging is limited to 30 watts max, not 21 watts as might've been told to you."
"Amazing video as always.

I would like to know what the quality of the cameras on both the zoom and wide angle compared to Samsung's z fold series"
"Watching this on my Razr 5G, which I'm likely to keep for as long as it lasts, but very excited for the future of foldables! We're back, boys"
"Very cool. Super excited about Google getting into the fold community. As I watch this video on my DUO 1 I have to say I cannot go to a inside screen unless it's glass. Even though the DUO has the split, it's the glass inside that works for me. As a mechanic I constantly have grease, dirt and metal shavings on my fingers."
"I thought the same thing: It feels like a (better) Surface Duo. If Microsoft use a foldable screen on Surface Duo, it could be like this."
"Good camera + AI, this might just be a great travel phone, the larger canvas for using Google maps and the great cameras for taking photos
If I was to drop some aussie money on this, I'd like Google to have some repair partners in easy to find locations so if something does happy, I can get it fixed"
Huge bezels threw me off!! Looking forward to the Fold 5!!!
I believe the ideal footprint for a foldable phone when it folds as the size of pixel5. And its thinness should be Pixel5 x2
"It would be a strong contender for me if it just had a couple of things. 1) A stylus. I like to jot notes down and occasionally draw. The fact that they have a device with such a large screen and zero stylus support baffles me. Especially when the Z Fold has had it for the 3, 4 and of course the up coming 5. Even the Find N2 has support for one. 2) The other main issue is that it is using the, lets face it, lack luster Tensor G2. A SoC that is already weak compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, let alone the 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy that will surely be in the Fold 5. It falls behind in CPU, GPU and efficiency. I wish they had announced this as the first device with the G3."
"Wow , I have three (3) takes on this phone
1. Finally Google making a foldable phone means the future is all about unfolding.
2. Apple has no choice at the moment, they have to join them....... they couldn't beat them. 
3. Apps like Instagram and Co would finally take folding phones seriously."
"FINALLY ANDROID-L WOULD BECOME GOOD 

Btw Mike, would you rate the Pixel fold's cameras over Find N2 & Vivo X fold's?"
"Cool, I'd love if they did a flip style phone!"
"295 trade for a 7? I was expecting the price, but that's a real punch in the gut. All my excitement was instantly deflated."
"If I were a bookstyle foldable guy, this would probably be the phone I would get.
I love the Pixel phones and the software they come with. But alas, I'd rather have a clamshell foldable. So I'll have to stick with my Z Flip 3 for the time being..."
"Watching this on my zFold 3, excited to upgrade to 5 this summer. Hoping it will have an sPen silo."
Exactly service support is the issue. Michael you're spot on
"From the look in the firs seconds of the video i also was instantly thinking: Surface Duo. Funny you said it shortly after :D
 
But from the software side i'm also curious how that unfolds (pun not intended) because that's what android lagging the most: to support, and i mean proper support devices, which a not the typical rectangular smartphone, But i've learned the hard way, to not buy products for what they could be, based on promises of vendors and just for what they currently are and in that regard: The Pixel Fold is simply not enough right now."
"Guess this goes in the ring with the Pixel 7 and S23 for my next phone contender...S23 is currently $400 through Fi, so it's hard to justify $1,800."
"Lack of pen input makes me sad. I would much prefer the wider front screen rather than the candy bar form factor my fold 4 has, but the pen input will keep me in the fold for now."
"I'd love to see how YouTube performs on this phone. My biggest gripe with foldables is that they keep getting Squarer rather than longer, so you loose more of a video on YouTube when cropped in. Does YouTube play well on this wide-screen? Or perhaps does it flip to ""horizontal"" when zoomed? Thank you!"
"Man, I went through a period when I really wanted a Galaxy Fold (what I would consider the only viable foldable option for us US folks... Foldable flip phones just aren't for me). But they are so pricey, and I worry about longevity and fragility."
This excite me a little bit  because brands that actually sell devices in US might jump to start making foldables having an OS that is actually meant to be on a foldable
"Question: did you try Microsoft apps like outlook?  If it looks like a duo, does it apply Microsoft's 2 'page' solutions?  That would be cool.   And I am assuming no stylus support?"
Yessir! I am definitely looking forward to your full review on this one. Cheers Michael!
Thanks Michael. Great n fun video as always. Love the little extra nuggets of info that made such reviews uniquely yours.
"The only real question I have is will expandable storage make a comeback anytime soon. When LG went under, I only went to the S20 FE because I need that option for more storage w/o the expanded price tag. I hate that flagship phones did away with it for cloud storage .. and no company on the market is worth that level of compromise."
This looks awesome! Great first impressions video
"Thank you for posting this, I was looking forward to your review the most given your experience with foldables!"
My only criticism is the price. I'm fine with the compromises like bigger bezels for the camera and the questionable hinge. For the same price you can get a 5th Gen Z fold this fall.️
"the only thing its missing, for me, is stylus support"
"When it comes to foldables and flippables, I turn to no one else but Captain Two Phones himself. He's the TechTuber you can trust when it comes to that particular niche."
"Unlikely, but fingers crossed they make a clam shell fold for us who like small phones"
The video I've been waiting for! The big question: Will you switch from Galaxy to Google?
"I've been rocking the Find N2 for just over a month. I've been able to westernize pretty much everything about it (including WearOS pairing, Google Wallet payments), except for ""hey Google"" support. Not to mention it was hundreds of dollars less than the Pixel Fold will be.
Pixel features would be nice, but I don't think it's worth the tradeoff of slow charging, thick bezels, higher price and a deeper crease. Here's hoping many of the software improvements make it to Oppo."
"i'm not too keen on the landscape aspect ratio when opened it feel awkward to hold with one hand, but i love how wide it is when closed"
"Great to see competition, Z fold still go to though due to the software"
Mr foldable  love the review Mr Fischer class as always
Love the design. That’s a steep price tag though.
This phone may be interesting but that price tag is pretty high considering that the Oppo Find N2 foldable is like 1000€ here in my country
I'll be excited to see the Pixel Fold 1a ;)
I would like to know how good the Pixel phone really is in real world usage and if the Pixel watch is good enough to jump from the Mobvoi Ticwatch.
"Beautiful looking phone. I think it looks even better than the Fold. Unfortunately, after my repair experience with my Pixelbook, I can't bring myself to buy another Google hardware product. After the warranty ran out (by two days), there were no service centers and no spare parts, I was forced to buy a used MB off of eBay and figure it out myself. I'll just wait until a reliable hardware company like Samsung ""takes inspiration"" from them."
Awesome video as usual sir. Keep up the good work. Long-term subscriber here!
No active stylus support is a deal breaker for me. I use my S-Pen daily on my Z-Fold 4. I need that stylus.
"I just pre-ordered mine and depending on the call quality, I'll be trading in my fold 4. Can you please test the call quality? I traded in my pixel pro 6 because the call quality was awful. Hopefully they've improved it."
"I think Google (Android's owner) entering in the foldables segment will be the final touch for it to be not just the future of the phones, but the present for the most people."
I'm hoping this makes the foldable devices step up their camera and battery game..
not a big fan of the aspect ratio or screen bezels. but hopefully the fold 5 brings a lot more to the table
I’m so excited to see your first impressions and i cannot wait to see your personal review.
Looks great! Don't mind the bezels
I don't personally like the wide screen instead of the tall form of my Fold. I'll still be looking for thr Fold 5 to be my next upgrade.
The find N is still the best size and best looking after all this time.
"Modestly, Michael is the best phone reviewer out there! Thanks"
Haven't been to this channel in a long time...Im buying the Pixel fold...BTW Pixel fold caes are already available on Amazon
"YES! FINALLY! 

Im in a market for a Foldable but it always fall short due to the Camera systems. Im using the Samsung S21 Ultra and I LOVE the zoom and samsung seem to cut back when it comes to their foldables."
Can't wait for the full review.
"I would love to try it. But Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Huawei all have great folding phones but the caveat is never available in America."
Good coverage as always
I think Google took a step back on the inner display design with the bezels.. it reminds me of the old portable DVD players or the old flat screen TV with the bezels.. I will stick with Samsung or go with the Xiamoi Mix fold 3..
Excoting for sure but what's new vs Fold4 beside the different aspect ratio? Voice transcript and IPX8 have always been availblable on Fold4. Or even previous models maybe this part I'm not sure.
"So many questions but my main one, and the deal breaker, is will it have alt mode/desktop mode?
""They're not a sponsor, they're a subject"""
"I am glad Google entered the Market with the foldable ., but for the price it do not give me the wow factor and yes the bezels gives me an outdated feel and look. as for the App part hopefully google will have thinking out of the box approach and refined some current features that are in other phones on the market . The crase is not a major deal breaker but comparing what the Vivo and other phone manufactures have pulled off Hardware wise this a a step back ."
"""It's a surface duo with a folding screen"" yeeess! I've got a z fold 3 and surface duo to try out. The duo has a much better form factor, more satisfying in the hand I think."
Does this device offer stylus support? I am always using for rough sketches and navigation on my Fold 3.
"It's not the tallness that bothers people, it's actually the narrowness.



The Galaxy S23 is taller than the Z Fold 4, there are no complaints about its height.

Vivo Fold X is as tall as the Z Fold 4 but also much more wider for a better aspect ratio."
That 1800 price tag hurts to even think about. But I'm coveting it something fierce. I want it.
"I feel like I'm watching the same videos.  The bezels & the crease, I  thought we were past those discussions.  Thank goodness for bezels.  Extra comfortable gripping space!!"
"Hey Michael - is the Find N2 fully useful now? No chinese apps, non-translated setting options etc.? I was waiting for Pixel Fold but it would cost in my currency like 8600 PLN while Find N2 woulc be like 5200 PLN. I would go fro Oppo... just please confirm if it is not annoying to use such non-international model?"
It's missing stylus support.  I'm going to wait for the Z Fold 5 before I make my decision.  Although it's pretty tempting to pre-order from Google to get a free Pixel Watch.
I would love to get a foldable phone when the screens are better made. I still don't trust foldable screens enough to spend double.
Is there USB-C video output? During the I/O presentation the phone was plugged in so I am assuming they were using the connection for video output. I'm hoping they have not removed it in the production model.
wow.. thanks for a great hands on the Google fold. This is a really nice 1st generation folding phone. Does it have a screen protector and are there any cases. Thanks
Trading in my zfold 3 for it. I love my zfold 3 but the software annoys the hell out of me. I literally ordered the pixel fold within 3 minutes of its announcement. I can't wait to get it towards the end of June.
Are they going to introduce a flip version too?
"Please Michael make a head-to-head comparison between the Pixel Fold and the Samsung Z Fold 4 - thx ! And stay foldable, my friend :)"
"your video are the go to for tech, more pixel fold please in a review when its out. keep up the great work"
Surface Duo with a flexible screen?! SOLD!! Hopefully Google will also copy the Duo's method for switching between multiple dual screen apps.
I really love the foldable concept but I'm still not convinced about its longevity and resistance.
I'm using nothing phone 1 & I'm loving it I wish someday if nothing comes with foldable with cheaper options  I wish to buy pixel 7a but can't afford it
Always loved your reviews since day 1.. All the time GREAT! Keep safe my friend.
"Sooner waiting for this over Google’s key notes. 
Thank you.

1. I don’t mind about the bezels."
"Hi, Michael. Could you make a review on the Vivo X Flip? It looks really promising."
"The ""Wait, don't skip ahead."" prompt actually caught me going in for the double tap on the haha. Well done Mr Mobile!"
"I'm a bit hesitant, the bezels are big! The crease being still there make me worry about usability. I'm using the samsung fold 3, with phone inner screen naturally cracked after 1 year of use"
"Didn't expect your review to come this early, I am very happy you did."
I really hope quad lock or rokform make a case for this phone. Only reason I ditched the fold 3 was the lack of good mounts for my motorcycle. This phone makes me want to maybe find and Jerry rig something to work.
"The Pixel Fold video we’ve all been waiting for (seriously, I haven’t watched any of the other Pixel Fold videos bc I’ve been waiting for this one to watch first)!"
I knew he would be the one who would the happiest of the bunch for a foldable phone
"I want a Pixel Flip, gosh darn"
i like that its wider both folded or unfolded. the battery should be atleast 6500mah tho
"your Pixel Fold video is the first one I clicked on, I knew who to trust for foldable coverage :D"
The only Pixel Fold video i need to watch. Great video .
"Would love to have one, but I just can't morally drop 1800€/$ on a phone. Any shot of a Pixel Fold A coming?"
The first channel I went to for Pixel Fold coverage no question
"I wanted this so bad, but apparently it's not coming to Australia... 

Guess I gotta go get the Fold 5..."
As usual a great review!
Wondering how long apple will take to releasd foldable.
"As a current fold 3 owner, love the Pixel Fold's aspect ratio, love the UI, and for the the camera too.... However, not so sure about the chip set, and the bezel..... So used to the super, if not ultra, thin bezel for literally EVERYTHING, and the fat bezel will just make things look way older."
I'm still holding onto my Blackberry KeyOne and at this point these videos are pure sci-fi to me.
Looks like I soon won't be able to resist upgrading my ancient Oneplus 5T to a foldable!
Already pre ordered to replace my Z Fold 3. Cant wait to get to a pixel in the form factor I wanted :)
"""They aren't the sponsor, they're the subject""

Somehow it gets me"
"100% if someone told me Google worked with Microsoft to make this I wouldnt be shocked. Especially how the Duo vanished from the Market and the price thats being asked for the fold. The hing, the bezals. It reminds me way to much of a duo."
Thanks for the good review as always .... But still the traditional phone is better than foldable phone.
"Great first look, wonderful video!"
I think this will be the first ever foldable I get
I'm sold- I been waiting for google to announce this and yeah the price is high. Trading in my Pixel 6 to go foldable on Android.
The software part alone is going to be huge for all foldable phones. Android will only get better with the form factor.
"Oh who's better to discuss Pixel Fold, than you, the Mr Mobile ! 
Good to hear it indeed does close flush, and has the IP68 and is able to hold various angles of clamshelling. Cool that they are trying to convince Android to cooperate with the squared proportions of this type of foldables. Great that the foldability finally doesn't come with traditional sacrifiices in the camera department.  And D-Brand's case with a kickstand looks cute."
"I gave up on my Galaxy Z Fold 3 and bought an S23 ULTRA--BUT I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR THE PIXEL FOLD!.  The Galaxy z Fold 4 was just a slightly modified version 3.  I really only used that full screen for MS Word and Spreadsheets.  It never really capitalized on its size for Netflix or Amazon Prime Video and the shiny screen was nothing but glare at an angle.  The tiny front screen was a terrible disappointment, too small to do anything well.  I gave into the allure of the blazing fast S23 Ultra and the outstanding cameras.  Other than those features though, it's ho-hum too.  I should have held out for the Pixel Fold!  It checks all the right boxes at first sight."
"I couldn't get used to Pixel's poor battery life, regular UI bugs and clean, but very limited on features ""stock Android"" OS. The cameras were amazing but I like my S23U so much more  Glad to see foldables being mainstreamed by Google, though.  My next phone will likely be one of these bad boys."
I cant get over that $1800 price point
The Pixel Fold is interesting but at such a hefty price tag do you believe it stands a chance at grabbing the foldable phone marketshare?
The Fold I've been waiting for
"Hey Mr Fisher
Great first look. Question. Isn't having a third selfie camera too much? I heard they made those bezels big to accommodate more space for that selfie camera. But why is it necessary to have it in the first place, there are already 2 camera's, does it really need a third? Especially if you can use the main camera as a selfie camera. I'd rather have smaller bezels and no selfie camera on the big screen. Curious what you think and I hope you'll open a discussion for this problem when your review comes out. Cheers"
Huawei and Xiaomi are on another level. The Pixel Fold feels like a first gen product very much so.
"Given Google's hardware track record (as far as QA goes), I'm not going anywhere near this thing. They have enough trouble with 1st gen slab models. Nevermind something that folds (also, $1800 USD or [ack] $2400 CAD is a bit much to swallow!)"
This is the video I’ve been waiting for about this phone.
Your one stop for all the info on foldables
Is Google going to make a headset to compete with the air pods Pro Max? I'd love that
Just like the 6 Pro its will be best to wait until the 2nd gen of the foldable.
Was waiting for your review. It's finally here.
You should have left their demo with Niagara as the default launcher.
Next fold we need to see is the apple fold. (If it ever comes)
"0:36 the anticipation and excitement on mrmobiles face, I feel you brother."
it reminds me of Microsoft Duo 2 in terms of design.
"Shame the edges on the outside aren't curved, would look so much better. But that's just a personal preference from me, who would never buy a foldable lol"
Like the Pixel Fold display aspect ratio.
Thanks for the early look. I switched from iPhone to Fold4 a couple months ago and won’t be switching to this but glad to see it entering the space….
I knew this video would be coming. Glad to see your opinions
"I want to be excited for this, but with the G2 chip. I can't exactly be."
Nice to see a camera back in a bezel instead of the stupid bass ackwards hole-punch pandemic that's typical now but there are still some returns I'd like to see such as headphone jacks and removeable storage.
Does the Pixel Fold finally support Display Output via USB Type-C?
Not gonna lie I would trade my Z Fold 4 for this but I'm still paying the Fold off  perhaps the next gen lol but I do hope it works out for ppl. I wonder how samsung will respond in the up coming versions  if there's one thing I miss from a traditional phone is how wide the front screen is. Yes I can open my flip for better messaging but it's not what I want to do all the time!
"I'm glad to see some U.S. competition in the foldable space.

I guess Google and Samsung will need to duke it out until Apple makes this a threeway foldable fight."
It’s so weird to me why google still don’t sell their phones in many european countries like here in Finland
"This phone looks amazing, but the price is still a little prohibitive"
Only foldable I genuinely care for
This story about Google 'optimising Android for a form factor themselves' reminds me a lot about how they 'optimised' it for tablets ...
"Well... At least you gave the Duo the time of day this time... Lol...

Was gonna say could settle with the pixel fold until seeing the price... Either way enough time to see how well the screen holds up..."
"The best part is that it’s a Mr. Mobile video, the software, cameras, and tensor G2 chip, wish it was the G3 chip and at least a 8000mah battery two 4000mah cells on each side. 120hz displays on both inside and out is going to kill that little battery, would’ve been the best option for $1,800. Also stock Android is always good and smooth… That’s what she said"
"Does it have video out like my fold 4? Samsung offers dex and usbc out options, plus my tv's and Samsung monitors have a lot devise sharing. I bought the pixel fold, but the thing I really want is the front screen, unsure if I will keep it."
What about a foldable watch? THAT could make me swap out my collection of EcoDrives for something more techy.
"I still love the little disclaimers at the end in addition to your quirky video style, keep up the good work Michael!"
"After moving over to the Pixel 7 Pro from a Galaxy S21 Ultra, I have absolutely NO desire to go back to ANY Samsung device. When I was at a local cellular provider store, I was not impressed with the Galaxy Fold 4 either. It seemed closer to a normal sized phone when open and just too narrow when closed. I will give this Google foldable a shot when it is released. I like the aspect ratios of it both open and closed. Also the use of surfaces for screen real estate looks like it's just done better than the Samsung. I've been extremely happy with my P7 Pro. Not once have I said to myself, ""I sure miss this or that from the S21 Ultra."" As I'm coming up on a year of owning it, I'm not wishing something new would come out to replace it either. The new Google foldable looks like it would be a nice upgrade though."
I at least thought Google would do enough to be a upgrade from the z fold 4. Only way I'll switch is a great trade in value I can't refuse
"personally, i like the bezels"
Apart from the first razr this has to be the best looong foldable phone for me
"I can get 900 for my Fold 4 512GB, tempting. A little disappointed there is no macro mode on the camera, unless I missed that...."
"I am disappointed its not coming to more markets around the world (like Australia, but understandable why)"
I know you love folding phones and I agree that the tech is cool. But the plastic screen with a crease is always going to be a deal breaker for most people. Until that tech is improved foldables will never take off.
will we get an update of the oppo sw now when google have their own fold with better screen support?
"I'm excited, but I too concerns. 1. Can it only have two apps open? The Z fold can have three
2. Will they stand behind the screen? If it breaks, will they replace it without charging?"
Looks good.  You didn't mention the width of the front screen.
"I want it, I prefer the size, but 1,800 and if it doesn't hit the market as google wants, they will abandon it. - I'll wait for it to hit 800"
"Wow, it came out so out of nowhere I still can't believe this is real."
Gosh ...I was worried about the crease. Now I don't know if Google will get my money on this one.
This phone is amazing apart from the price and the bezel
"you should really use good lock on your fold, go into homeup and switch the app list to grid."
tempting to trade in my samsung fold 4 for this.
I really wish that they had built in a proper desktop mode like Dex or Motorola's ReadyFor.
Sweet! Google is taking their sub-par phone building abilities to the folding market.
I’ve been a long time Pixel owner since the days of Nexus. But the fact that Google isn’t offering a trade-in value for the 7 Pro is a huge turn off. And the values they’re offering are heavily deflated compared to previous years. Google gave me $410 for my Pixel 5 to trade-in for the $699 Pixel 6. And then I got $490 for my Pixel 6 to go to my 7 Pro. But now I’m expected to pay the full $1799 For the Fold? I think I’m going to sit this one out. As unfortunate as it may be.
Xiaomi's Mix Fold 2 is still the best foldable design for me. If only we could have a vanilla Android experience with it other than MiUI.
"The more competition samsung has the better the phones  will become. 

If you think about the fold 1 wasnt pretty,  this is going through the same growing pains, and will only improve the foldable market in the Western world ."
Fucking Legend Mr. Mobile!!!  Video as always! Cant wait to try the new P Fold!
"Need the fold to stay as tall, but become as wide as this."
That closing clop sounds so beautiful
"The Pixel Fold might give some competition to Samsung. I love how the hinge closes the Pixel Fold than what the Fold Series gives

The $1800 price tag will make or break Google when it comes to making more of them."
I'm a Surface Duo owner. Been waiting for the 3rd gen but will have to get this instead
The landscape of folding phones will only change when Apple enters the market. They will be late to party but they will set the trend to follow.
All those Pixel perks work in US only so not really for me unfortunately :(
"Part of me drools, the ideal dream device that can double as both my mobile and computing device. But not $1800, not for a first gen device. Not when that inside screen can still so easily break."
"Does it support writing on the screen, and how is multitasking like ?"
"Love your videos bro
You're my favorite phone reviewer on the world wide web."
"However impressive, as I love the idea of a “digital Moleskine notebook”; this still seems to be too much of a prototype to consider, especially as a daily driver. On top of that, Google has a knack for dropping product categories out of nowhere, and I don’t want to be holding the bag if they do."
"I like the concept, I think I want to see it mature and proven over a generation or two before I jump in. Probably going Pixel 8 Pro next."
"tbh I wasnt much expecting much from google from their 1st folding phone, but it's nice to see they're trying some new things."
"I have a Fold 4 right now, it will be very interesting to see where Google takes this product line in the future!"
"It's likely that they'll be trying to get an under display selfie camera to an acceptable level of quality in time for the Pixel Fold 2 release, which will allow them to significantly shrink the symmetrical top and bottom bezels of the inner screen, and possibly make them uniform with the side bezels. Google has a patent for under display camera tech, so they've been considering it for a while."
"Would actually love to give this a try but that price is nuts, I definitely prefer the form factor of this over the Z Fold 4"
The bezels look fine. Love the surface duo form factor.
I love how Marques released this live while Google are presenting it at IO
I’m really interested to see how Google will optimize apps for the phone.
"Finally another real competitor in the global market for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series. Hopefully this pushes them to improve more on their foldables, and not just minor upgrades each year."
It’s a very pretty foldable that’s for sure and I love the slightly wider form factor
How does video look in landscape with it open? This is probably my main drawback with exploring foldables--would love to hear anyones thoughts/experience on this?
"Not a fan of foldable phones, but I’m curious for Pixel's Flip. I think that looks cool"
"Really wish we'd get that  dock on the normal pixels aswell without having super small scaling, it looks so useful for multitasking."
"i just realized something about the folding phone architecture. this type of design allows for binocular cameras. this would probably require a ""Depth Perception Mode"" in the camera app. the photos and videos from this would be absolutely insane!!"
I like the design of the Pixel Fold. I'd love to use and test it to see how it performs in real life situations
Seems impressive and promising. I probably purchase the fold only when fold 2 is released tho after google fixing all the flaws on this. We all know back then the pixel 2 was a huge improvement from the original pixel.
I think this will help make foldables easier to make from other manufacturers. That's why it's so important
You hit the nail on the head with the question at the very end. I know it's first Generation and I want to be sure that hinge is good plus I want maximum software compatibility with folding and cameras. I'm not sure if I should wait or go with Samsungs Multi-generation foldable. Cost doesn't matter. Functionality and durability matters... But it looks fantastic. I'm excited. I'll be switching from slab to a foldable for the first time So I want my experience to be great. Looking forward to these new foldables.
"Even though I'm not the target audience, I am curious of the device itself and wondering how well it performs and runs. Can't wait for the full review"
"I've never liked extremely thin bezels on tablets, so this aspect is positive for me.

Tiny bezels may look great and function well on phones, but it's awkward when you have to use both hands on a larger device. I'm hoping the next generation will feature bezels of identical sizes on all four edges. Hopefully, they'll introduce a larger model as well."
Would love a foldable comparison.
"I like Google's approach here. They studied market and other manufacturers like Samsung for years, then fine tune everything and listen what's galaxy fold users are saying and make the product. I hope this will be a perfect product from its 2nd iteration."
So basically this is a market test for them to find out if they have enough brand power to stop offering their phones for less money than more prestigious brands. Good move. They don't have enough brand power with me though.
It's a great start. If you don't already have a foldable phone I would say go for it. I have a fold 4 and would rather keep mines for the time being. The best thing about the pixel is that the apps will work seamlessly and the cameras will be best in class.
I love how it's the same shape as the 3ds. I'm sure that you could emulate some 3ds or and ds game on this device really well
"As always with Pixels, the PFold 2 will be the one to invest in!"
"I liked how the main screen is big, something we struggle with in Samsung fold4. I'm not sure if I will be into the Pixel software but let's give it a try"
"I have a fold 3, bezels on the interior screen are nice to have. When folding/unfolding, holding the phone in general, it makes it easier to not accidentally touch the inner screen."
I really like it so far it looks especially nice folded
"I love your content, and the sneakers. I stumbled across your review of Bose companion 2 speakers from years ago, as I just bought a pair. It’s quite amazing to see how far you’ve come. Keep up the great work."
"even though I'm not too big on folding phone's, I love my pixel 7 and I think google making a folding phone may turn out quite well."
"I actually can't wait to get my hands on a nice foldable phone in about 5 or more years when they really improve it. I like to read on my phone, so that screen will be amazing."
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
"Thank you for pointing out that bezels help give you a place to grip the phone.  Modern phones are really frustrating for me, because they're hard to hold securely without touching the active touch area."
"Interesting, can't wait for the full review soon. Don't really mind the bezels as well but dang pretty pricey at $1799."
"I was considering switching to the Pixel Fold, but I just started working in a cabinet shop. I can't have that ""X"" in the IPX8 rating, that didn't work out too well for me when I got the first Pixel making granite countertops"
I still use my first gen Pixel XL from 7 years back and can see that it looks like it somewhat.
I wish they make a non foldable with that outer screen : I love that aspect ratio
"Can't wait for the review. I am excited about it, but let's wait and see. Samsung is unfortunately frustrating us in the way of how slow they improve the z fold"
"Here in India, the Pixel 7a price got disclosed in Flipkart before the event even started."
Would love Marques to do a video into the reality of long term ownership of foldable phones. From most forums it seems they’re not ready yet
"From the UI, the app dock looks very similar to the one that's been on Pixels since the 4 - apps with rings are ""recent"" or ""ones you usually use around now/in this location"", apps without rings are fixed. If you drag an app from the drawer into a ringed spot it becomes fixed. If you empty a fixed spot it becomes a ringed spot"
"0:42 I love the detail that the words ""design"", ""hardware"" and ""software"" are in the same colours as the laptop wallpaper in the back. Nice job!"
"4:59 I've been doing this with my Z Fold 3 for ages. It's not new. It's a task bar that shows a couple of recent apps, and 5-6 customizable ones, which you can have there at all times, or just when you long press the gesture bar."
"Video as always.
Do you know when we can expect the full review?"
"Going to keep an eye on the fold going forward, August September if review and software live up then ill likely get one to replace my note20 ultra"
This obsession with thin bezels has introduced so many compromises that everyone has to work around. Hopefully they make a comeback and people realize it makes more sense.
"Nice! Pixel foldable finally here! And I'm sure that will be quite an impressive device, but for 2k ill buy the Pixel 6 and one good laptop and I'll be 10 years ahead"
"Love the screen tho, especially the aspect ratio. Nevermind the bezels, but it looks really comfortable to watch different kinds of videos on there, because it's not close to a square like the Z Fold is."
Love how it's the same shape as the 3Ds
I love the shape and what they are trying to do with it. Far better look and feel than the Fold IMO. It's just that price that keeps me away from buying the folding phones.
Curious about the charging. Would be cool to see magsafe type charger for this so could work or watch videos during travel without all the cords.
"In my opinion given the design choice, specs and entire outlook of the folding phone landscape, google isn't gonna ship many of these pixel folds, it'll probably be in their second attempt that they see some improvement, provided they refine their approach, cause this fold is asking a lot for what it offers"
LOVE that shirt! So many videographers trip over 24fps but don't know how to articulate it's movement on-screen and when it's applicable to change to a higher frame rate.
The dock looks like a layout similar to the standard pixel. The dark circles around the app means it  is recommended and the ones without circles means it stays that app. SO it suggests to me it can be customized.
Looks awesome and definitely a folding I would buy but man that price.
Being able to use the rear(good) camera with a viewfinder is S Tier for content creators!
I was hoping it would have pen support. That was the make or break point for me. Om staying with my fold 4 for a while
"That price rules it out for me, even with the ""free"" watch, I'll also be interested to see the battery life reports too"
It’s honestly not to bad of a phone and I’m glad you reviewed it it for me I would just go with the normal one bacause it has a bigger batter and a better form facter
"Watching on a fold 4, will be interesting to see if any issues with a mk1 product, thought I was safe with a mk4 fold, but first one broke after a few days. 2nd one has been perfect."
"I believe you are exactly correct in thinking with the price as high as it is, many people will wait.  I have a Pixel 7 pro and would consider trading it.  With the trade the cost would go down to $1,419.  They are also giving a Pixel watch with it.  I may be able to sell that for around $200 to get the cost down to around $1,200.  Still a lot for a phone."
"i actually love the bezels. I am tired of the non bezel, it's not as functional"
0:33 Love how the text is colour matched with the wallpaper on the laptop
"Also the Fold 4 has an option in settings to hide the bottom task bar (long press instead of swiping), similar to what you guys showed with the pixel fold. Very curious to see the durability of the pixel!"
I miss big bezels! Having somewhere to hold a phone was so nice.
Would be great to have this form factor with Ubuntu on it.
"Officially it'll be available in the United States 🇺🇸, United Kingdom 🇬🇧, Germany 🇩🇪, and Japan 🇯🇵. That's one thing that's unfortunate about the Pixel lines of phones, lack of official availability on a global scale."
Still love the design of my duo 2 and I'm gonna stick with it until ms stops supporting it which seems to be very soon.  This looks intriguing but I still have tons of questions
Let's wait and see how it compares with Z Fold4 which I absolutely love.
I love the Pixel 7Pro and the software experience but I cannot get past the $1800 price for the fold with not much more hardware or processing prowess. I think it's going to be a tough sell!
"That price is gonna be interesting. I think the Samsung folds have sold okay i sometimes see people with them in the wild but i don't see pixels as often tbh, and this is gonna be even more niche. I'm a bit confused why they didn't give it 16GB of ram tbh. I feel like if you're a folding phone that should be tbe standard."
A generation of kids don't know how cool it was to flip phones back in the day
"This is crazy, I was literally searching on eBay and about to pony up $1500 for a Surface Duo 2. Now this came up on my YouTube feed. I trust Google way more than Microsoft when it comes to a fluid multitasking Android experience. I'll be one of the first buyers for this phone, can't wait for it to release!"
"As a Samsung fold 3 owner, I think the most annoying thing is the aspect ratio. It's not good and it more frustrating then anything. I hope this becomes a focus for folding phones."
"I bought a Pixel 7 Pro on launch day, and to be honest I wish I just kept my Pixel 5. The 5 had the fingerprint on the back and was the perfect size. The 7 Pro is nice, but pretty big for my liking. I will probably keep it a couple of years and then hope there is a smaller pixel option at that point."
"Samsung is going to be honestly hard to beat on software. I am super impressed with a lot of it on my Fold 4. There's just so much you can easily adapt to your liking, like I designed a custom key layout for my native language yesterday just because I didn't like the stock one. I do expect camera processing will be better on Google tho."
"I have an interesting question.. Ok so right now on Google Pixel phones if you try to open a multi-tasking windows with an app like Instagram for instance then an error will show up saying ""This app does not support split screen"". My question is, do you think Google is going to force Split Screen like Samsung does, or do you think they'll take some alternative route?"
"I've been quite interested in this one in the absence of a new Surface Duo from MS. I have a Surface Duo 2 currently and love it still, but that cheap plastic on the bezel isn't holding up so well long term and the back glass is broken, but not even MS Support can get me a replacement right now. I want a dual screen phone with the better short and wide form factor than the long and skinny Samsung. I hadn't really considered Oppo for a long time being how it is getting most of their stuff outside of China."
"As a Galaxy Fold 3 owner, I am absolutely thrilled to see more competition in the folding phone space. Samsung's widespread availability of the Fold and Flip line gave it a de facto monopoly in many countries that didn't have access to the Oppo Find N2; more companies competing for foldable market share will help drive innovation up and prices down."
that trembling movement at 6:42 to 6:44. Nice! impressions as always!
"When Google saw that Oppo find N fold they were like That's it. Let's go with that style. I like my Samsung fold 3, just wish the front screen was about that size or close enough."
"I love how in every first impressions video Marques does, he sounds so excited about the product. Love it!"
"I just recently bought myself the pixel 6a and I gotta say I am AMAZED by how good the software experience is. A folding phone by google with a great software experience definitely sounds great but in my opinion if they want to beat the competition they would have to lower the price of this phone to at least $1500 since they are not putting high end hardware into it. I don't think they need to put in better hardware personally, I think the software experience of pixel makes it unnoticeable but if they want to win over new customers then well, price gotta go down."
"Dude you are right about the battery, my P7P barely lasts to 9pm, now you have a handset that has significantly more current draw due to the screens.  I'm waiting for your real world test"
"One of the reason I love my galaxy Fold 3, is the candy bar design"
"From using the surface duo, I felt that a phone without that gap in the middle with all of the pixel-y touches would be a banger device.  Now whether I feel that at 1800?  That's a different question. Hopefully they are feeling generous with the trade-in values."
"I would have thought these foldable phones would have huge batteries in them, since they've got essentially double the internal volume?"
As someone who likes to read a lot on my phone (a Pixel 7 Pro) this layout would be absolutely perfect for me but the price is way too high. I'm still holding out for a more mid-range option in a couple of years.
I usualy hate the looks of bezels but this one is a bit like an iPad mini or Air. And those tablets have a great look.
"Bezel's are not a problem with me tbh. I'm more interested in how the phone performs in terms of multi-tasking. Z fold's multitasking is crazy, hope pixel fold will do same or better :)"
Subtle matching the font colours to the screen background on the Mac at 0:35 amazing attention to details
"I just upgraded from a pixel 3 to a pixel 6. Once my current phone finally dies, I'm definitely gonna try to get the pixel fold 3 or 4 at that point, cuz I was planning on getting the Samsung Galaxy fold before I had to get the pixel 6 lol"
"As a big google person I've been Pixel camp since before it was labeled even labeled 'Pixel' I'm talking HTC One days. So safe to say I was early adopter to the 1st Pixel, absolutely loved the Pixel 2xl, Pixel 4a 5g now I'm rocking the 7Pro and I was excited about this one but that price is a killer! It will not move at that price!"
$1800. That’s mad. Good to see some competition though. Looks a good bit of kit.
Awesome! I'm loving the Pixel line! I just hope they continue Pixelbook as well. The whole ecosystem is fantastic. Go Google!!!
I actually love the look of this thing. It’s the first folding phone that I could see myself owning. You just can’t beat Google’s software. That price though! It’s equal to 2 base model Apple MacBook Air M1 laptops! Is it the cost to manufacture that is making them so expensive? Or is it the economy of scale that makes Apple’s laptops cheaper to produce? Great overview though Marques. I can always count on a great video from you. ALWAYS!
would this be a better option than Z Fold3?
"I am using fold 4. So technically, front camera in-display rarely I use. And good enough for video calls. Si I think bezel less display looks fabulous."
Great video and great phone! I don’t think that many people will buy this before the price drops to 1499 for Christmas sale or Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
"LOVE how you banged out this video was so quickly. I would say it definitely looks impressive. As a person who has a Fold 3 and only rocks a Google Pixel 6 Pro because I LOVE the Google UI, Haptic feedback as well as the camera, I may have to scoop this up. I also LIKE the shorter/wider form factor compared to the longer/narrower one of the Fold series. Honestly it's either this or the OPPO Find N2(which I can get for cheaper here). Thanks again for the video."
What the foldable makers have really mastered well are the prices especially after binding two phones into one!!!
"Having the Samsung Fold 4 as my first foldable, the Pixel Fold is tempting, but I think having been a Samsung user for so long, I'll likely wait for the next Pixel Fold model and it would have to be significant reason(s) to switch!"
Its an important step by google. This will guide the Android industry/manufacturers towards better and unanimous UX experience with all the changes in Material designs. Foldables will be more and more preferred in coming days. Great progress :)
That's a good ammount of bezel. Easy to grip without fear of actuating the screen. Now if only the price wasn't insane
I like the design and software of the Pixel Fold. The $1800 price of the Pixel Fold is going to make or break the ability for Google to make more of them
"If battery life is good, I may hold out for a sale. Otherwise I'll be looking more closely at v2 of this. I love the pixel design and software"
The Oppo Find N2 looking like more of a good deal after this reveal!
This is pretty neat for the first iteration of a folding phone. Good price could make a dent in the market.
I want it so bad but it's definitely outside of how much I'd be comfortable spending
"I wonder if there's going to be a stripped down ""a"" version as with the other pixel phones. It'd be interesting to see how Google would strip the experience down into an 800 dollar foldable"
"Despite the phone, I can't move my eyes from your T-shirt 30fps and then I realized no 60fps at the quality options button (like most Youtube creators did). I don't know what the reason is, but for me, 60fps has a specific use case. Tech video review like this is too much using 60fps. I'm really impressed with your tech-wised character and also influenced on how you review the product. Love it."
They could just have eliminated the edge bezels while retaining top and bottom. It would have given effectively a better screen for media consumption while retaining all the hinge mechanism and camera hardware. A miss for sure in 1800 Dollar phone.
I’d be interested in the vertical flip. The open book method doesn’t appeal to me because I could just buy a small tablet and save hundreds of dollars
"The reason I would get this over the galaxy fold is because of the wider screen on the outside, I don't mind the bezels on the inside."
"I've been waiting for this phone for a while, been using the Z fold 2 and 4 but I hated the narrow outer screen. So, the wider outer screen on this phone is big welcome for me."
"I’d say one for the pile. Don’t get me wrong, it looks great. Probably performs great too with the wide form factor but there will probably be quite some negative impressions after further testing. Especially on the battery in combination with tensor 2 - side of things. The price is ridiculous. I should’ve start my comment with that ."
I want to see what deals the carriers have to make it worth it
What’s crazy is we’re in that era of calling 30 Watts “slow charging”
I can only imagine what Apple will charge for their folding phone whenever it comes out
Phone looks great! Battery for me is what it would come down to.
This is an amazing first go for googles first fold. I always wait until the second or third gen though!
"google has been half assing since they went on with the pixel series. I remember the google phones from different manufacturers were well put together, especially the motorola nexus 6. That was favorite phone for so long.."
"Personally, I am still on the fence about using a foldable as my daily driver, I feel foldables are still not refined enough. My wife's had a ZFold 3 for just under a year, she got onto the bandwagon for the phone and tablet being all in one but over time she just couldn't get over how think and heavy the thing is so now she's waiting for the Z Flip5 instead."
Now this may be a foldable I'd like to buy...
Wish if it comes with pen..the screen size is perfect when it's folded but the pen is really important to shift from  galazy z fold 4 to pixel fold
I'm looking forward to it. I've always loved HTC phones and Google made the right choice in buying their phone division
If fordable phones didn't wear out so fast I would consider buying this phone. But after year two becomes problematic is just unacceptable lifetime for me.
"I like the concept. I see the camera bump of the future with Google. Noice! I wish for no bump tho. Battery life will definitely be questionable because of 7 Pros good battery, this will be a bit more intense on impact. What about the speakers? Same?  Ill take one once the price drops $499."
"Looks like a  nice device, but that price is pretty crazy and I'm not sure Google has the same level of trade in options as Samsung.  Makes it a bit of a tough sell, despite some interesting features"
The bezel that big is good if you want to lay the phone on a surface (body/bed) and still see the entire screen
I have an iPad mini and older pro max iPhone.  Which seems odd - big phone small pad.  But this New device is basically both combined. It’s got the right form factor for me.  I think that will do well as an alternative to the Samsung devices.  If I was in to android I’d be very tempted
"I am glad google released this, so hopefully we will get more software features specifically for foldables. Samsung added some decent features for foldable phone, but I am curious if having google make features will add even more features"
Google never dissapoint us when it comes to pricing
"We are waiting for Apple's entry into the field of foldable phones, and if it enters it, it will definitely bring down all competing companies as it did with the laptop or tablet and others. At the moment, the Huawei foldable phone is the best phone in the world of its kind and Huawei has created it madly."
World's first techtuber to not lose their mind over bezels
Love the color grade on this video!
"Glad to see Google jumping into the foldable arena!
I love my Galaxy Fold 4, and I'm deciding if the Fold 5 offers enough improvements to make the switch. The big advantage to me, between the Pixel Fold and the Z Fold 5 is I am expecting Samsung to offer a very good trade in allowance for my Z Fold 4, which would bring the Z Fold 5 below what it would cost (me) to purchase the Pixel Fold."
"The bezel looks fine, it seems to work with that phone probably due to the screen size once opened, it doesn't feel like the bezel is reducing the screen significantly"
"I can't wait to see where foldables go and how they develop over the coming years, it feels like the first proper development race between phone manufacturers in a long time, but in my personal opinion where they're at right now they're not worth the kinda money they're asking. A few years down the line however, when foldables are a ""normal"" phone size/thickness when folded, and are a decent tablet size when open, with minimal bezels, decent battery life and a durable screen, then i'm interested. But right now i'll stick with an Ultra or a Pro model over a foldable any day"
I pre-ordered mine already and also pre-ordered a latercase for it
"I wonder how Apple’s foldable will be. Knowing their standards, it should be pretty awesome"
"IMO, thick bezel is actually ok if it serves an actual function. It helps you hold the phone and manufacturers can put better hardware into it like better speakers, camera, e.t.c"
"I was super excited about this phone. To be fair, I still am to an extent, but that $1,800.... I just can't stomach that, along with the fact that it's a first gen foldable. Besides, my Pixel 5 is still going strong. Hopefully the Fold 3 will be worth the switch (and price), because I would LOVE to get my hands on a Google foldable."
"I think you are right about the price overshadowing the whole thing. It gave me pause, but only because it feels like price has been a pretty big motivating factor to get people into the pixel world. This is truly a product for fans of the Pixel software experience, but the price is too steep for me, even with a free a pixel watch. I am having a hard time justifying taking a dive into this foldable."
"This is the first folding phone I've ever had interest in so I'm excited, but I can't justify $1800 on any phone.  Maybe I will snag one if some deep discounts come in.  Personally I can't think of what a phone would have to do for me to be willing to spend $1800 on it.  I probably spend $3K to $5K a year on tech, but I know this phone will not be SIX TIMES better than the Pixel 6a which is my favorite phone of all time.  Even if I don't buy the Pixel 7a and a new Chromebook, I would still be $800+ off the cost of the Fold.  The Fold will also come with all of the negative trade-offs of a folding phone while on the other hand the 7a follows the formula I have loved for years.  I guess it all depends on what you prioritize in a phone.  My final thought is that if I were looking to buy a folding phone...  It would 100% be this one.  Or imagine $1800 for One UI???  XD"
"Pretty badass looking phone, but gotta say, that price Does anybody remember when flagship phones were 700-800$?  Doesn't seem so long ago, does it?  I seem to remember really wanting a Nexus 5 when it first came out and it being around there."
That price tag could break this phone.   I wonder what deals they might have for someone that wants to upgrade from the 7 or 6 pro
Love the fact that you use the site for your new shoe release on the Pixel screen. Very clever my man
"I would buy it, but seeing as it's Googles first foldable, I'm going to wait to see if they learned from Samsung on the cracking screens or not."
The black one looks like a finger print magnet and that price point is outrageous. Its a good first attempt.  Im sticking with my Fold 4 though
I rather have those bazels than any notch or camera hole punch on the wider screen.
I love the matte glass finish. They FINALLY brought it back.
Thanks for the short first impressions. Concerning the dock. Hold the dock on the Samsung Fold(4) also hides the dock when you're using an app. Hold on the place where the dock was does show it again....
"Amazing phone! 2 questions:

Is the back Glas glossy or frosted?"
Not gonna lie that bezel is wild. This looks like a prototype
Look forward to picking it up for 1/3 of the price in a couple of months once the fold 5 is out
I honestly couldn't care less about folding phones tbh. Love my S22 Ultra and all the Notes before it. I don't need bigger and don't want smaller.
My next upgrade is between this and the Xperia V. Very impressed with this phone. First foldable I've seen that I'd consider buying.
I'll stick with the Fold4! Hopefully Google keeps working on it!
"I love my z fold, best phone I've ever had and totally worth it."
I think I like my Fold4 more. Display is definitely nicer too
"I like it. I love my 6A and honestly, if I see an iteration of this at $1000-$1200 in the future I am getting one for sure."
"So being on the S21 for a while and waiting for the foldable to get better is interesting! However, that price tag is a deal breaker for me. 
I really like the design. Being thinner than he Find N2 and lil bigger is excellent. I'm totally down with some pezel to get it thinner."
I think considering other foldable phones i would get the best camera in the world for a phone obviously and the best android software in the world! It's a win win for me and 1800 bucks sounds alright for me i am definitely going to buy it as soon as it's available!
I couldn’t care less about the bezels. The form factor is FAR BETTER than the Z Fold 5. Super excited. To see and possibly buy this thing as my first foldable.
"Having a tablet experience in a foldable is probably better for this form factor. Most foldables only have overblown apps that doesn't utilise too much space. I hope developers will have better implementation of their apps on a foldable cause otherwise, there's no difference than a normal phone."
How about the performance? Which one of the 3 performers best?
"I freaking love your shirt! So true, HOWEVER, if you export your  30fps 4Kfootage as 60fps and upload to youtube AS a 60fps video even though its still 30fps, the image processing is way higher."
When you take just a few seconds to think about why smaller bezels is what you want; you realize you actually don't care and that it was just a design cue that we got accustomed to.
"Everyday I'm crossing my fingers for a more affordable foldable, and unfortunately the Pixel Fold isn't it. Still hoping for a Galaxy A Fold, maybe around $800 or below, but I can only wish right now"
"The intelligent features of Google software on their phones are above all, I would buy just for that and because I like foldable phones. If you have never seen the intelligent features and the hold for me stuff, you should really check it out on their other phones. I missed it immediately when I went to my fold 4."
"It looks amazing of course, but at least from an artist perspective it's a big hit to hear that it doesn't have stylus support, but maybe it was just a little rumor idk"
"I would love if there was some sort of “try it for a week” program or something like that. I think a lot of people are interested in folding phones, but the price makes it a very tough pill to swallow if you don’t even know if you’ll like it. I think they’d sell a lot more of these if there was some way for people to try them out for a short trial period."
"I don't mind the bezels, as long as it is symmetrical top and bottom.

In fact, for this phone, the top and bottom bezels make the inner display feels more wide-screen rather than square."
I cant wait for the full review. Its not worth quite that much money to me honestly. I want to give it a shot because foldables are interesting designs and forces devs to be quick to update software. The other thing is... google has the reputation of abandonware and id hate to spend 1800 on a phone where all the apps look awful due to poor design if they give up on it. food for thought
Internal screen bezels make it look real gen 1  This is gonna be real good if they stick with the line though
"They should keep the bezel. They could put some good speakers in there.
This is the first generation, in a few years it could be better and cheaper.
Let's go Pixel :)"
do I also get this dock behavior (quick launch) on my pixel 7? would be nice..
"You should check out how the screen looked in the live demo at the Keynote, in the right lighting the crease on the screen is quite visible and it also kinda looked a lot more ""plasticy"" than the other foldables if that makes sense but not so much when you're looking at it straight on."
I'd love to see a tablet review
Probably not great out of the box but with updates could be awesome.
Love the background Marques! Makes me miss seeing the Cheerio boxes back in the day
"This is a phone I’d consider as a long term iPhone user, in fact I’ve never had an android smart phone. This one is getting close to something “else” I would want."
I hope they get to make a second iteration of this phone. I dont see this first one moving units. Pixel phones are never record breaking though having a loyal fan base.
Google is improving...but by making things more expensive.
In the full review can you take a deeper look at the hinge on the phone and if the display will start to fail after so many times you open and close it?
Google has redesigned and integrated the apps with it's top tier AI engine.  That's huge.
"It sucks that these foldables aren’t easily accessible to most due to the price point. 
Maybe OnePlus comes up with one which is less than $1000?"
I’m one of the few that apparently still like bezels. It’s part of the reason I bought a Zenfone 9
The perfect size in a foldable Phone is like Oppo Find N2.
Will the apps actually show more text on the screen? Or will it just be a resized experience?
"Graphene OS + Pixel Fold will be 

I hope Google lets us unlock the bootloader to flash custom roms, like on the normal Pixels and Graphene OS team will make a version for Pixel Fold. A De-Googled Foldable would be so cool."
I truly enjoy foldables. Got the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 and now the Oppo Find N2 and I will never want to go back to a regular one.
"I have a Fold 4 right now, it will be very interesting to see where Google takes this product line in the future!"
The bezels look fine. Love the surface duo form factor.
"I love how in every first impressions video Marques does, he sounds so excited about the product. Love it!"
"That price rules it out for me, even with the ""free"" watch, I'll also be interested to see the battery life reports too"
"Even though I'm not the target audience, I am curious of the device itself and wondering how well it performs and runs. Can't wait for the full review"
"tbh I wasnt much expecting much from google from their 1st folding phone, but it's nice to see they're trying some new things."
This is what the Surface Duo wanted to be
I'm excited. Definately my next phone... Maybe not this model.. but in 2 years time.. hell yeah
lmao I thought they was going the find N route to not only have a foldable form factor that actually makes sense but to find a price sweet spot near 999 - 1300 but 1800 is so wild
"The thing about software is that unlike Apple who controlled the AppStore and the iPhones/iPads market, software developers in Google PlayStore don't have that much incentives in optimizing apps for Google Phones, since the biggest userbase of Android is actually held by Samsung. But who knows? Maybe this phone combined with Samsung Fold 5 will sell better than expected thus creates incentives for those developers to better optimize their apps for foldable user experience."
I can't wait to see a durability test for this
"After owning the galaxy fold 3 for a couple of years, i'd be very wary about buying another folding phone...it developed a thick black bar right down the middle of the screen which means i'm left using the narrow front screen"
My work is google based and mostly remote and travel. Would love this for on the go video calls and editing docs (if work paid for it)
Those bezels can accommodate another phone
"The good thing about Pixel Fold is 
1. we can automatically be sure that it has the best camera in all Foldables. It will definitely force others to work more on that.
2. Now google apps will need to work with foldables, and so does a lot of more apps."
The way the books in the back left match the theme on the pixel
I like the design and software of the Pixel Fold. The $1800 price of the Pixel Fold is going to make or break the ability for Google to make more of them
"Literally the first thing I thought was “oh man, those bezels ” but then he explained why they are so thick and I just thought “oh, that’s why”"
"If I had the money and didn't just buy the 7 pro in December, I honestly would consider this...I've always been hyped for the folding pixel, but yeah."
"1800 dollars is a hard pill to swallow., even you're a fan of Pixel and really really like foldable phone.  It's the first generation for Google and the direct competitor is Samsung.  I think they just make it for testing market but not expecting a big sell.  Looking forward to Pixel Fold 2 or 3, if they can keep that up."
"Dang, all these foldable are getting taken out by the zfold4. I was going to trade mine in for the zfold5 but I thought they'd change the aspect ratio for a wider front screen, looks like I'll be staying put for a long time."
"They r launching it at $1800, but they will be selling most of them for much less ""On Sale"" and on Black Friday/Cyber Monday."
"I have a Fold 3 now and I really like the format, thin folded and square ish unfolded. These fat wild format foldables seem less comfy to hold it folded but haven't tried so who knows. The bezel definitely look weird."
"Im curious about the software optimization and how google gonna build android for foldable phone. But 1799 is just way too expensive. Right now u can get fold4 around 1400 and the hardware is definitely much better. Also if u can find somewhere to buy, xiaomi, honor and vivo all have foldable phone around 1100. For me 1399 and a free watch would be a rational price"
"I’m uneducated in foldables, but I’m never sure how I feel about them. It does look fun though!"
If it came with a 4 year guarantee I would buy it. But I cannot risk having to replace the phone after 2 years because the internal monitor kicked the bucket for this amount of money
"Marques, I had an interesting though where I considered the possibility that when companies send you and other creators their phones, they are sending you the best possible version so that you could make the best possible review - you could say that the phone is ""Creator Grade"".  Is it likely that companies would actually make something like that and ship slightly lower quality (by a small margin) devices?"
"Looks like a great device, but yeah the batter and the price . I feel like this could be googles surface duo. Great ideas and good hardware, but just too expensive. If they could have come in around 1000-1200 they would have a giant beater, but 1800 is a tough sell considering samsung and other manufacturers in the market"
"Never used a foldable before, but I like stock Android and like the look of this. Will definitely be looking out for this as my second handset."
"Looks more of the Surface Duo 2 than anything else even the hinge, big difference being the folderble screen and the fron screen. 
Based on the rumours the Surface duo 3 will look something similar (praying they also have a front screen)"
"I have a Fold3 and Watch5, it's time to move on.  I pre-ordered the Pixel Fold with the trade in and free watch came down to $999.  That for me was a good enough deal to switch."
Did we ever imagine a time would come when 30W charging for a phone would be considered slow?
"I think these kind of devices will have a good future, but for me they are not mature enough yet. Price, battery and durability will improve over time and personally that crease on the screen is still too disturbing."
"Well, at least they’re trying. Let’s hope they get it right, design-wise, next time around"
"You should check out how the screen looked in the live demo at the Keynote, in the right lighting the crease on the screen is quite visible and it also kinda looked a lot more ""plasticy"" than the other foldables if that makes sense but not so much when you're looking at it straight on."
"What google is trying to do here is to combine tablet and a phone in a single device. The price range doesn't make sense for me, even if I go out to buy an iphone pro + an ipad, it would be cheaper than buying this device."
"I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I love bezels. One of the things I hate about modern phones is the fact that the screens go all the way to the edge. Several times a day I'll be holding my phone and ""fat finger"" the edge of the screen with the meaty part of the palm where it connects to the thumb. Sometimes I'll literally fat finger the other side of the screen because my fingers are ever so slightly curved over the front. So I much prefer to have some small bezels so it's easy to actually hold the phone without accidentally touching the side of the screen."
I wish I knew the Pixel Fold is coming out in May when I got my Z Fold 4 in January .
"As a first device my guess is that they still don’t have the production capability to sell many and they don’t want to deal with too many complaints from faulty hardware so you put up the price few enthusiasts buy it , they’ll complain constructively and then v2 will be 1499"
This fold reminds me of Microsoft's Duo (if the Duo had an extra screen).
"I've been waiting for this phone for a while, been using the Z fold 2 and 4 but I hated the narrow outer screen. So, the wider outer screen on this phone is big welcome for me."
"The pricing isn't really bad tbh, every other folding phone costs as much at launch"
"Once Pixel join this game, 3rd party apps maybe more optimized for tablet and foldable device - that's a point we waiting for"
"Talk about the Mi Band 8, it would be interesting"
Was considering buying a small tablet has Cellular connection so I can take advantage of the free data sim for Fi. so if it makes this an all in one option then the premium price could make sense. Would have to see some more daily driver reviews to consider it though.
"If it was a few generations back I might have tried it out, but I've been bitten enough times now early adopting hardware from Google that I know better. Battery life specifically I'd always err on the side of caution with Google - I actually felt like I'd been chumped for buying the pixel watch, and the fact they're giving them out for free now makes me feel like they know the value of them too. Theres no benefits to being on the cutting edge of Googles devices, only downsides."
I think reliability will be the deciding factor on whether I will buy one. Interested to see how the failure rate pans out
It's too expensive for me but the preorder bonus makes it tempting. I'll see if they extend that offer to carriers because I'll never buy hardware from the Google store again.
"As someone who works in the cellphone industry. I can tell you the amount of folds and flips that go out the door even with trade ins taking $800 or even $1,000 off sometimes is slim to none. But I am excited to see how the support translates to Samsungs fold getting better."
Do you have an idea of when the full review will be out?
"I’d take this foldable after all the numerous Samsung z fold problems. Yeah it’s 1,799 but the great trade ins deals makes it a no brainer"
7:22 I think it was launched at this price so that next year when they do deliver supposedly people don’t bash them for raising the price. The first year is just a warm up
"Marques either chose the backgrounds and angles of his shots very carefully, or Google finally solved the crease problem of folding screens. I think i saw a very slight crease in one shot, but other than that the crease is basically invisible."
Finally a foldable that looks like a normal phone when folded.
"Love the concept of a folding phone...definitely won't buy one until they are sub-$1,000"
These folds are gona make me broke loll… currently on the Fold 4 and iPhone 13 mini (primary phone) and I think I’ll stick to that.
I'd only pay $1800 for a ROG folding phone
"I am a big fan of, dare i say fan boy of the Pixels. Still, i am a conscious consumer and that price man... i really want it... That price is steep though ... a lot of us are on hard times so i don't know if this is the right move for Google Pixel line. I really expected them to make the Pixel 7 move... decent stuff with an undercutting price."
I truly enjoy foldables. Got the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 and now the Oppo Find N2 and I will never want to go back to a regular one.
"As a pixel fan, I'm surprised I actually like this."
The fact that we consider 30 watts charging slow now is crazy lol
Now that Samsung & Google pixel got on board with the folding technology..it’s time for Apple to start thinking..
"It might sell. I have a fold 4 and I am very happely with it, but i would trade if it absolutely blows it away. Doubtful though after looking at the spec sheet."
Would've preordered but no release in Australia
"Hi Marques. First of all big fan of your videos and loads of love from India. 
I'd love to see a prominent youtuber like you and also others talk about the recent green/pink line issue faced by users across multiple countries using mobiles with led display from well-known manufacturers. It has become a widespread issue with no straightforward easy solution for the user who spends his hard earned money on these devices and do not always get even the acknowledgement from the manufacturers regarding this. I think when the tech community will start shedding light on this, it will be properly addressed and huge number of people will be relieved."
"$1800 would be priced about ₹1,80,000($2200) with current pricing trend here in India."
"I don't mind the bezels at all. It makes it easier to hold. I actually dislike how thin the bezels are on my iPad pro, I can't even use it like an iPad I can only use it on the magic keyboard stand like a computer."
"I really do not know why people freak out over having a small bezel. I much rather have a small bezel around the screen than not have one at all. When you one hand a phone, or just have it resting on your fingers, having that edge to edge screen with no bezels means you will pretty easily just accidentally touch the screen a little bit. While f there is a tiny bezel, that just never happens."
"Interesting enough, whenever I think about smartphone prices, I kind of imagine smartphones sales will eventually need to become similar to the console sales model, where the hardware is sold to consumers at a very low price or even discounted at a loss while the cost is quickly recouped from the sales of services (Play Store and Apple Store cuts on in-app purchases as well as cost for devs to put out apps on the stores has been paying back the price of phones with even lots of interest for years now....  Clearly manufacturers indirectly get paid as a result from exclusive deals like specific bloatware and default search engines, I wonder how that doesn't get mentioned often...)"
"honestly, bezel is fine! i feel like pushing the screen to all four edges of every phone hasn't been a positive thing"
Honestly I'd be interested to see what Apple will do in the folding space. I use android but seeing like an inbetween of ios and ipad os would be interesting.
They are opening with a Pixel Watch for free leading me to believe this phone will be HEAVILY discounted fairly shortly after it is released. I'll wait and see what they offer for my Pixel 7 as a trade in.
That was my 1st reaction. Holy bezel Batman.
Remember when the Nexus 10 was supposed to improve the Android tablet experience? Me either lol
This is a hard pass. I have a 6 pro and I'm waiting for either the 8 pro or possibly Pixel fold 2 if they bring the price down and put the hinges on the back to thin out them bezel
"PixFo () is a bit pricey w/ a few unknowns ahead of your full review, but I’ll probably cop one anyway …

 Thanks Marques for getting a Pixel Fold vid out quickly—been waiting for news on this. You’re the best in reviews!"
"It should of been $1,599 if they really wanted to make a dent against Samsung. I was excited for this but with the Fold 5 and the N2 under 1+ coming I'll definitely be holding off. Also Samsung trade in deals are nice and put a decent dent in that $1,800, I dont see Google matching those prices."
"Google would've fared a lot better if they priced this at around $1400. The only reason why it's high in price is the obvious folding feature and that's it. Every thing else is done better by other foldable phones on the market, notably the Z Fold 4. I have a 7 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro which both are solid for me. But I thought about getting rid of both for the Pixel Fold if it checked all the boxes and it sadly doesn't. I'm sure the 2nd generation will be better and somewhat justify the price"
"That's what the surface duo should have been. With the software partition splitting the screen. Always loved the nexus and pixel devices tho and Googles wait was worth it tbh. I use my phone for phone stuff.. Browsing and media consumption and my pc for everything else so this looks all good on paper unless your phone is your main device.... But really who doesn't have a pc or Mac for serious work? There is major drawbacks to both android and ios, for anything serious."
#1) How much crease distortion in the screen will incur over time? As it will.
I love folding phones. I think they’re so freakin cool. But $1800?!! That’s more than my rent you gotta be kidding me lol
"GoogFi is offering the pixel fold for the $1800, but then with $700 phone credits (over 24 months) to sweeten it a bit.  This makes it within the neighborhood to their current offer of $1000 for the Z fold4.  I wonder if other phone carriers are offering similar discounts?"
Too expensive for me but looks good.
"In regards to the North American market, the Pixel Fold will be taking on the Galaxy Z Fold. Apple will not come out with a foldable phone and has placed all of its effort onto the AR/VR headset. The Pixel Fold ought to be a good buy for a 1st generation foldable because Google has learned from the trials & errors from the Chinese Foldable market such as Xiaomi's Mix Fold series, Oppo's Find N2 and Vivo's V Fold series. Even the African dominant vendor from China, Tecno has a foldable phone for the Middle Easter & African regions."
It's a no go for me.  I love my s23 ultra and that ultra zoom
Catchy thumbnail  also the video marcues love from India🇮🇳
"I believe it's actually a very, very smart price from Google.  I think they learned from Microsoft and the Duo.  As MS did, Google is pricing it to keep the ""wanna try"" type away.  If the component sourcing and manufacturing process was more stable these days, they could avoid this and build more to meet demand.  But I bet that Google will only have enough capacity to make about 3K to 4K a month of these devices.  So, the price will help ensure that those that are willing to pay will actually have availability."
it's nice to see the shooting date on the phone :)
"HEY NOW, might have to upgrade my fold 3 for this... but idk about that bezel on the inside, ugh and you hit the nail on the head! Need a good trade-in deal!"
"It doesn't matter how good PixelFold is, it matters because android apps will now support foldable and tablet devices."
Just love the graphics of your Merchs man
"Foldable is the stepping stone to whats really amazing,  the expandable scroll like phone"
I can't wait for midranged foldables in 5 or so years.
"Pixels used to be the phone to get. Price to performance and the extra google features like free google photos etc... was all worth it.
I got a pixel 6 and i was BURNED HARD! i have to go samsung from now on. This thing has so many glitches. Apps crash, the other day split screen froze it 100% couldn't do anything but hard reboot it. and bluetooth hasn't worked as intended in over a year."
Getting so many google phone notifications from all the creators
"I love how pixel attempts to join the fold family. But for that much , they must really do better than the existing samsung for it to stand out from the crowd"
"I think all these foldables should be comprehensively compared to TECNO's phantom v fold, being $1000 , nearly half the price ,it really exposed the over pricing these companies have on folds."
This makes me want google to make a flagship tablet
"Overall, I like it.  And I dont mind the bezels at all.  However, at $1799...... I think its a tough sell.  

With that said, now that Samsung is beginning to have competition in Nirth America with folding phones, hioefully that would trigger competitive pricing going forward."
This actually the first fold phone i like it looks so good lol
"I do think this is my favorite take on the folding phone. I also feel that its going to end up being the ""budget"" folding phone as pixel phones often go on drastic sales and if that continues for the fold, we could see it as low as $1400-$1500"
"That t-shirt really grinds my gears. There is no superior frame rate, especially when it comes to youtube videos."
"Never understood the big deal with bezels, those look perfectly fine, I prefer that to barely any at all when it comes to usability"
Reminded me of Microsoft Surface Duo2 in more ways than one internal screen + Price.
"Lets put this in perspective- it cost as much as my first computer in 1993, but does alot more and fits in your pocket. The only thing it cant do it take up a huge amout of space and  tie up my parent's phone line while I'm on the internet."
The inner display bezels is HIDEOUS
I'm so impressed with how fluid and versatile it is. Well done
"For the price, I expected the Tensor G3 to make it's debut. Also maybe quad speaker?
For the rest of the hardware, it looks amazing."
"That rear camera module design looks so good, I hope they put it on the upcoming pixels"
"Was thinking of pre-ordering it and trading in my Pixel 7 Pro, but then I did a comparison of the camera specs and thought maybe not. Also it's really really overpriced, just like Samsung's fold. There's zero chance of me paying that much for downgraded cameras and unknown durability, plus a tiny battery. I was expecting Google to be aggressive on the pricing because of the compromises involved in buying this product, but disappointingly they weren't. If they'd knocked off the price of the watch and given me a trade in discount to make the price reasonable, then I'd consider it."
Pretty impressive multitasking features
"Love the multitasking features of my z fold 2, but I missed my old pixel's camera and other features. So stoked to upgrade to this!!"
"I'm glad they brought Frosted glass back. 
I'm hoping Pixel 8 will have it next."
The most impressive piece of hardware i've seen in a while...
I am surprised there isn't any stylus. Looks beautiful
"wow i''m actually really impressed at the functionalities of this foldable phone! very cool, unlike the other foldable phones we've seen sof ar!"
"Would absolutely love one of these, wish i could afford it"
It looks stunning but I dare not even look at the price!
Missed the chance for a stylus. Also I like how they aren't scared to show the translator isn't perfect.
Just placed the order.. I'm so excited to handle it   I wish from Google to release it before June  50 days too long to wait!!!
"Fantastic, as expected!"
"You get what you pay for, and this is totally worth it! Can't wait to have it in my hands."
Let's gooo. Raising the bar on foldable devices!
What an amazing piece of art especially what this phone is capable of doing is astounding
Looks like this will be my first Google Device
"Was totally stoked even knowing the price until today. I'll probably still begrudgingly purchase, but 295 trade for a Pixel 7 does nothing but highlight how fast Pixel value drops"
Nice work. It's like three pixel 7's in one
"I never want a phone more than i do right now to get a Google pixel fold! 

I never even care to get any flip phone to this day, but my god, when i saw your presentation for Google Pixel Fold, i immediately want to buy it."
Ok that real time translator function is pretty neat
Would love a Secure folder option like Samsung.
Hope the Canadian market release comes. Was looking forward to this but it looks like I'll be waiting a while :(
I just pre-ordered mine soooooooo excited!!!!!
"I wasn't expecting that at all, Impressive."
Amazing phone. Looking forward to upgrade
Google pulling out all of the stops. Impressive!
"Trading in my 7 Pro today. :) I've been waiting for this since I bought the 5. Now if only YouTube would get Shorts out of my feed permanently and/or let me turn them off, it'd be perfect! I wouldve liked stylus input as well, but I can live without that."
"Looks amazing, exactly the form factor I've been waiting for. 
Now you just have to start selling in Switzerland"
This is certainly the only foldable engineered by google
"That's the phone I've been waiting for, and I've been waiting for a long time!"
"It's pretty impressive and I would like to buy one, sadly making Google fi activation only from USA makes it inaccessible."
"I like my current Pixel 7 Pro, with the price being a major selling point (compared to my outgoing iPhone 13 Pro Max).

I’d like a folding phone, especially this Pixel one. But the price! Sorry, I’m just not going to pay that amount."
Insane!
"Considering the battery of the pixel 7pro with the tensor g2, this one with two screens ... let's hope it arrives by lunchtime"
"Do we know if it has expandable storage?
This question is literally going to be the deciding factor if I switch from my Note 20 ultra or not"
the only thing I like more than the others is the screen aspect ratio
"Would never give you my money, but the live translation looks amazing"
It's so beautiful ️
I think i might prefer this than the s23 ultra.
Oh God! This multi screen translation function opens a new horizon for foldable devices.
Beautiful phone by google. I have already Pixel 6 Pro
"Samsung better end their complacency because Google has now entered the foldable market with top tier cameras and periscope zoom in the United States.

Competition will benefit us consumers and I say that as a S23 Ultra user."
"I know you are making sleepy Microsoft jealous. Samsung, not so sure. My Pixel 6 I have come to love. I bought a Google Blue phone case. Pretty nice. I will go and check out the details. I am loving the Bard experiment so far. The conversations and fact digging are a blast!!! Keep growing new ideas Google Team!!!"
They telling the features in all pixel phones except it’s a foldable engineered by Google
Drag & Drop looks really nice to work with!
I want it ...and I believe it's important to support the Fold...but my wallet is saying to wait for the 8 Pro.
Best foldable phone i ever seen hard and soft goes in perfect harmony
Very good video presentation! Top level
"My P5 is near enough at deaths door (had it for 3 years) and I was holding out to buy a new phone. Not sure whether to wait for this (i love niche stuff) or just pull the trigger on P7P

Thoughts?"
"hope google store will expand to croatia, i really love pixel phones"
Google solved the folding screen conundrum Samsung can't seem to fix on their Galaxy Fold phones. Well done Google!
"I was really anxious of seeing this and of course getting it but, really disappointed it's not coming to Canada..."
Does it have desktop mode when connected to a monitor and keyboard?
Google does it again
Please start distributing the Pixel on México already!
That translate thing is incredible
I need a promise that this one wont boil my screen.
this will be my 1st foldable phone! gg! can't wait!
"Very nice, coming from an apple fanboy. Looks great"
"$1799 in the USA, £1749 in the UK! Yes, the US price does have to add sales tax, even taking that into account, the UK price is just ridiculous. The Samsung Fold 4 sells here for £1649. Google's set price makes it the most expensive folding phone to buy in the UK."
Wow Double Screen with Double Satisfying!!!
Can't wait to buy this.
"this is quite a statement. Congrats, Google!"
I love my pixel 7 which i got today
$1800 is insane for something like this.
"Wow it's awesome
But I can't afford it right now
Waiting for refurbished models"
"Woow this is so awesome, will you guys als proceed with hub 3?"
looks great
Hope it's available in india
"I cant believe this is so freaking awesome, count in, Google! Ima buy it SOON!"
"""The Google Phone: The Only Phone Made By Google""
We have reached tag line purgatory"
Finally a non iterative upgrade in Pixel.
Looks like the Microsoft folding one with those bezel.
"Large bezels really a deal breaker for me. Why don't you put punch hole camera , otherwise it's a very good design and impressive software."
"I was kind of disappointed by this announcement, hope Google can make the next version of the pixel fold less dissapointing"
Awwww. Prettiest Fold Ever
"One reason I want a fold phone is for productivity, does the phone have a desktop mode when docked so it can replace my work laptop?"
Next level innovation
"Bring this to Aus, but even then will be waiting for a massive price cut or will be looking at used in the second hand marketplace. $1799 USD is just too rich for a Pixel with Tensor G2, when the competition Z Fold 5 will have agressive pricing with their trade in bonuses and pre order gifts, and the sheer performance from the SD8 Gen2 or Gen2+ processor."
Wow better then I thought
Althought anyone talks this or that. This introduction shows that Foldable phones are the next big thing. And Samsung is the pioneer in this uncharted future.
"Здравствуйте, дорогая корпорация добра! Любллю все ваши устройства за их безупречные функции и лучшую производительность при соотносительно невысокой цене. А так же, как считаю я, лучшую камеру на рынке смартфонов(огрызок яблока - простонервно курит в стороне).
Пишу это сообщение для того чтобы спросить вас конкретно, не расяитывая на обратную связь, но всё-таки, - когда и как купить такой произведение искусства как Pixel Fold находясь в России?"
there's no way it's 3 days battery life ?!
Keep it going google
It's a shame what google has released in this event. Those bezeles are bringing me back in 2014. Both fold and 7a are a joke
#TeamPixel ️
For the love of God SEE THIS PROJECT THROUGH! You tend to can a lot of projects…one reason I don’t invest heavily in Google products.
"Its better than my oppo folding phone, upgrading now!"
If only you guys bring an eink colored mobile phone into the market.
"Always wanted a pixel fold and tablet but it's not a good time to release them, the playing field is different than it was in 2022 and the yrs prior. Pixels also don't even have freeform windows multitasking. I just hope these won't be abandoned if they don't sell well"
Watching it even though I can't afford it
"Looks great, but I was hoping Google would undercut the market, not match them.
Still tempted."
"Does it work with mirroring in ""linked to windows""?"
"When regular premium is not enough, you get “Ultra Premium“. Good old capitalism"
I cannot wait to see what Apple will  do ?
Will he get one of them from Google as a token of friendship
"Love you Google but this ain't it. If the Fold 2 ships with less bezels (even if it means having a hole punch), Tensor G4, your version of an S Pen,  bigger battery, same camera system as the 8P, expandable storage, and drop the price by 300, then I'm in."
"YES.
LOVE THE DESIGN
THANK YOU GOOGLE"
Wow this is advanced fold phone . Wow fantastic. What ever it take I own it.
#madebygoogle️
Awesome. too pricey. i was hoping it was more like 1200
Watching from my Pixel 7 Pro
Geez I really hope I made the right choice
it's lovely!!!  Only !!!!  team google pixel
Not gonna lie the translation part blew me away
time to purchase Galaxy Fold
"Really , Google is so perfect bro, I wanna a pixel Fold please"
What about the 8 series?
Does it have wireless charging?
"Ok - they 'never' show it closed on the a side view (I mean you have to pause to capture ""the"" frame at 1:49). There is something happening there that they are not so confident...."
It will be amazing
Disappointment there’s no pen support. Was so ready to leave iPhone and iPad
Annoyed this is not coming to Australia. Unbelievable
Would it be available in France ?
Great Foldable..........the price......not so much!!!!!!!
When is it expected to arrive in India
When is it releasing in Australia?
"Notice how they choose to say ""72 hours with extreme battery saver"""
Is this the first Pixel not available in Canada?
It's sad Google is not releasing in Australia.
#teampixel love you from badin Sindh Pakistan ️
samsung really should be to increase they tolophoto lens to 5x optical zoom with periscope
What a beautiful phone . I'm switching from my Z Fold 3 to Pixel Fold . Great job Google!!!!
Finally Perfect
Oh yes finally!!! Popularity becomes more google!!!
Please launch Pixel devices in Pakistan
Ok Android 13L optimization seems good and interesting
hmm still watch this space for me.. being a fold user for 2 generations kind of think fold 5 maybe the way go
Still think foldables are useless  for me imo
What is security feature of this pixel
What about the PIXEL 8 series!!??
Unbelievably well designed phone and unbelievable that canada is being left out... come on google do better.
Google have you tested the folding screen or do like other brands that the screen breaks right away? Otherwise it's useless
Is it the only foldable engineered by Google?
"Google software is getting further and further away from the competition. Price is definitely painful. Wish it was $1,500. Giving out a free pixel watch was a smart move."
Looks good. Not £1749 good but good.
Will it be coming to Australia this year?
Can you just release dedicated back case for it
1:53 why is my phone vibrating at this minute
fantastic. please improme batteries on ur phones
This will be best because google made this
OMG the price! This or MacBook pro?
"not worth 1800 tbh, looks really nice but too expensive"
Hmm...Looking Wow
What is the plan to make it available in Malaysian Market?
"Wow what innovation it’s look unique , I think is going to be a hit , I bet you know Asian company will be copying"
I want buy one but not available on my country.
that bezel kills it for me
But unavailable in India
for that amount of money a bezel like that is scandalous
I am disappointed you have decided not to launch the Pixel Fold in Australia.
Man! i cant its so expensive  but I want it!
Wow that really cool
i'll wait for next version that has a pen
Bezel as thick as my orignal ipad lol
""
"Ridiculous price with that processor lmfao and bezel??!!  You just crushed my hopes, ibetter get myself samsung fold 5"
just loooovvvvveeeee  can't wait
"My thoughts are simply, Google you cannot claim to want to provide a Tablet or Foldable device and not take multitasking into consideration, it's not done that way, it gives literally no reason why a current fold user should switch, POP UP MULTITASKING works so well even on Samsung slab devices talk less of Samsung's foldables, it's stupid at this point why they haven't taken this feature seriously, I don't want to have a tablet or foldable if i can only open two screens at once when i could open up to 6 on my current Samsung ""PHONE!"""
So no Stylus support
Headphone jack? Physical fingerprint?
"It's a nice phone, but those bezles are a little too thick for my taste. I'll stick with my 7 Pro for now. Hopefully the Pixel Fold 2's bezels will be slimmer."
im ditching the iphone for this. so cool Google!
""
I can't wait for JerryRig to let us see how that sexy hinge works
️
""
Well it's official Samsung and Google should team up to drop apple off the market
Explain me why this product should exist instead of just releasing Galaxy Z Fold Google Play edition or something.
Waiting
When they have a video chat from 0:44 how is she still visible with no angle change of her face during the fold? :D
In Mexico it’s Cheaper than the Samsung Fold 4
""
But why every single pixel are so bad for video calls ? Irrespective of any apps the results are always under-processed. Its too bad that it looks like we are using a phone from 2015
":( not for mexico, i love to buy  one"
Nice
History being made and I'm early
All the best
Can you make it available through the Canadian store? Thank you
"I hope it is more reliable than the Fold 4. I will never buy a  Samsung fold again.  I have had three.
My advice is to let others buy this product first and wait for reviews after 12 months of use."
I want one
"Ah, I just wish it was so expensive."
My iPhone will now be my backup
Why no stylus to improve the productivity through this device?
""
""
Meanwhile iPhone has dynamic island.
incroyable
"I want it, but since it's using the same tensor chip as the 6 and 7. I gotta pass. Had terrible reception. First google phone I'm skipping since the Galaxy nexus..."
Looks weird Todd I can't believe I'm buying it
I see I'm still not in the target group. Odd marketing strategies from Google.

Steep price though
Google pls launch your online store also in middle East/ GCC countries

Z fold user here. I'm switching as soon as this is available. Samsung ecosystem is trash and I've been waiting for a device to switch to. The user interface they force on us is like force feeding me internet explorer in 2039

"Tbh I don't like folding phones, I'll just wait for the 8 pro."
I wish i could win the lottery so i can buy this 🥹
"reduce the bezel next time please, i want one."
Price too high. 1400 seems reasonable
So tempting
Hot!
Is there a desktop mode or like Samsung DEX?
this also is a good phone google
"4800 maH battery with 2 screens and an extremely inefficient Tensor chip, this is a 1/3 day phone"
with that price n that 2010 bezel ... humm...there must be a saboteur among google executives...n its a sad thing google employees hyping up the ph in the comment section
PLEASE RELEASE IN INDONESIA
Very noice.

This a winner
Canada left out once more. As hard core google fan  really disappointed and mad. Google do better.
I wonder if it comes with gender pronouns and who in the right mind is going to buy an $1800 foldable phone that is pretty much a pixel 7
too expensive
Y'all are JOKING with that price!
Thanks Google for making it clear the Canadian market is isn't important to you.
Bezzels and chinn and price is very high

Anotner overproced foldable....
"People need to stop saying folding phones are OVERPRICED.
Folding phones ain't for the PEASANT class.

The piece of ** made by google
"Not so impressed with design, very thick bezels and overpriced"
Far too much for the out of date hardware
hmmmm….
Overpriced phone
I am here
Looks like an unfinished prototype desperately released for some Market Share before it's too late. Let's not even talk about that price.

What a ugly phone..
such a ugly design display chin looks like 1st samsung foldSee the huawei mate x3 far more stylish and usable futuristic design

Those bazels are ugly

"I'll be very fascinated how Michael Fisher will feel when he gets this Pixel Fold and reviews it. He's been using foldables since January 1, 2020. For this entire decade. But he's only been using Samsung foldables for the last 3.5 years. Those other ones are test units. Be curious how he'll feel going to a non-Samsung foldable as a daily driver for the first time in this decade."
Will wait for the review. But i still like my Flip 4.
This looks exactly like the surface Duo except with one display instead of two.
Wow expense. I'm in Canada and we aren't getting it a launch but at the $2400 CDN price tag I can see why. Even the current Samsung Fold is cheaper.
"People are saying, just wait for V2 or V3. Maybe I will. First generation products do usually suck. And you pay the most for them that might be filled with bugs. Let them refine it a couple more times. 

My biggest concern is if I wait...What if it gets bigger and bigger like the Z Folds? I've read last year that the Oppo Find N3 to be released this year will only get bigger. Oppo may never return to the size of the first two gens."
If the Google Pixel Fold doesn't have a pen that comes with it or at least if Google doesn't sell a pen that the consumers can use on the phone then I don't see it selling like crazy to consumers like the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 did.
"People, use the split screen keyboard. I use the split keyboard on my surface go 3 and I will use the split screen keyboard on my pixel fold. It's very convenient."
"Me: Picks up my Duo 2
Google: ""thinnest foldable""
Me: Looking at my Duo 2.  If ya say so...."
This is a surface Duo with a foldable screen
I dont trust the longevity of these foldables but i really like this design
It looks like it doesn't open up all the way
$1799 ouch
I'm a Google Android person but you said some things that make it hard for me to think about putting my seven pro down.. that crease thing is annoying... The thinness sounds good but would prefer if it were overall a bigger phone. How crisp and bright is the screen?.. Im feeling hesitant about this new flagship flip phone by Google.. I'm still debating but I do know they are offering a free pixel watch on the pre-order..(while supplies last) so that might make it worth it..ha!
Very sad attempt by Google. Maybe next time
Goddamn that inner screen has quite the bezel.
"Nice vid. Nice moment when laughing with the poses of the girl. Good humour always welcome on tech reviews, keep that in mind ;-)"
The crease
"Looks like it doesnt fold all the way open like others have stated, bad design on a 2000 dollar product"
"Other than power users, this is really overkill. I'll stick with my Z Flip."
Yay!
"Pass it won't hold its value,  it's a pixel device so you know it's gonna suck for a year and need updates."
No it's not!
This is ugly! Sveral other manufacturers have much better designs! I'd keep it closed just to avoid seeing the inner screen with those giant bezels!
"Going to wait and see, but very exciting. If they offer compelling deals for black Friday this might be my first foldable"
"I think google could nail a flip-style phone...
I like small and compact phones, that's why i chose the 6a when it launched, and i have been considering getting a Z Flip 5 recently but now i'd love to see Google's version of something like that..."
The more I see it the more I like it. Love the form factor. Don't like the bezels. $1800 is steep.
"I got a used Fold 3 for $500, absolutely love it.   and it is great that more people are getting into the foldable market.  having a tablet that fits in your pocket is amazin.  but $1800 is way too much for a phone."
"$1800, that's a REALLY tough sell."
That did look impressive. I'm definitely interested to learn more about it.
"It works for me...smaller than my P7 Pro until I am somewhere where the big screen is handy best of both worlds for me. Waterproof, wireless charging, and a camera that is as good as one I have....which makes it the best. I ordered it seconds after it was up and before I finished the keynote, and was thankful they nailed everything I need...Tho I do not need the watch that comes with it....I use a Garmin watch with 2 week battery life , along with being the best watch for golf...Charging a watch everyday doesn't work for me."
Absolutely love folding phones and this product is probably the item I am most excited about this year.
Looks like a Surface Duo lol. But I like the bigger front screen.  Thats what I dislike about the Z Fold 4 I have is the narrow front screen.
"I love the size, i just hope they allow you to be able to remove default widgets of the home screen as this is what frustrated me about the pixel 7 and ultimately what caused me to change to an s23. I also love stackable widgets so if they can come up with a those like the way apple has done it i will be waiting in line to buy one."
The bezels on the fold are similar to the iPad air. I personally don't mind that the phone has a bezel. In fact i am glad because that gives the user some additional room to hold the phone securely
"It's a folding screen Surface Dúo 2 with a much better camera and internals.  As a former Surface Dúo owner, that's fantastic!!  Exactly what I want... Except for that price.   Going to wait until it's on sale in a year."
"Let's just say I'll be sticking with the Zfold for now. The software implementation and taskbar are way better on the ZF4, as is the near zero bezel design of the inner display. This is still a first-generation Pixel, so there may be hardware issues."
"I have the Galaxy Z Fold 4 but I still want this phone. LOL! I actually think the bezel was a good idea for the internal camera. Also, the ratio of the screens are so much better imo. My only complaint is no stylus and price point. But honestly, I don't use the stylus as much as I thought I would on the Z fold so maybe it's not that much of a draw back. I do use it occasionally."
"Form factor looks to be good, but I'll what to see what OnePlus will be bringing later on this year"
Haven’t been this excited for a pixel in a while. Preordered mine after a few first look videos.
"My issue is, for 1800 the fold 5 seems to be giving us more bang for our buck. Spec wise battery and processor etc. It'll be a hard sell. Though looks interesting enough"
I am more excited than I thought I would be. The price is still too steep for me. But I will be watching.
I can't see myself happily handling a phone this wide again. Brings back memories of the bad old days when the Note 1 was like holding a bathroom tile.
It looks really good. Makes me excited for the new pixel when they show it. Hopefully it gets some of the tech they are using on this
"For someone who hadn't bought fold 3 or 4 and looking tor a foldable, its a defenant yes to the pixel, for the simple fact that the formfactor is better and great for one hand use and most importantly it comes from google"
You can only be impressed with a first generation product if it actually broke ground. For instance if it launched alongside the Galaxy Fold 1 four years ago. They had at least 4 years of research and development to go in to this product. Many before it risked it and paved the way for where we are at now.
"From what I saw in the Google I/O, this would have been a no doubt trade up from my Galaxy Z Flip 3...except for the price. That will be the one major thing that keeps form upgrading to what is otherwise a really genius smartphone by Google."
"I like it tbh. Two things  i want to see in pixel fold 2 is improved bezels and more importantly, a proper stylus. I know stylus isnt good for these types of screens but there is no point buying these big screen without a stylus. Hope Google does something regarding that"
I think the Google pixel phone is amazing but still the prices too high:-(
"I totally agree that the bezel size isn't really an issue. Maybe because I have an Amazon HD tablet and am used to bezels. The price is too high, but you do get a Google Watch with it, for what that's worth"
The price tag is steep for sure. Being a long-time Samsung Note fan and owner will make any change more difficult. I like the dimensions of that Google phone. I can't wait to see it physically. My S22 Ultra is an amazing phone .
I have been waiting for this form factor with google support. Had 2 Galaxy Folds and so want the wider outer screen and landscape opening. I have ordered one in the UK. Cant wait.  (BTW trade in for the UK was so bad! didnt bother).
When Foldable prices come down more I might buy one. I'm one of these people that hate watching videos and movies on a phone screen so to have something double the size might be better
To be honest I'd love to hear about the tablet
Phone looks super premium! Love it! So thin!
"Wow, indeed the thinness is very attractive. 
I can't believe Google is able to achieve this with a first version.
Very attractive, though that initial list price is steep."
"Foldables just got my interest now Google finally has a foldable that I care about, no other foldables were even considered for me and the Pixel Fold will have the best Android tablet software just like they have the best An software on their phones in my opinion and I think Apple will have to make an iPhone foldable now."
Really cool design. I’m hoping Apple releases their version of a folding phone.
"Been rocking Pixel phone since 2017 and now as a minimalist and anti social media, I'm happy with my AW ultra and Airpods pro 2 combination for my daily use while my 13 mini switch off at home for the past 5 months now. Not into big phone google oh I sometime bring my Ipad 6th gen for YT and light reading."
"I'll be very fascinated how Michael Fisher will feel when he gets this Pixel Fold and reviews it. He's been using foldables since January 1, 2020. For this entire decade. But he's only been using Samsung foldables for the last 3.5 years. Those other ones are test units. Be curious how he'll feel going to a non-Samsung foldable as a daily driver for the first time in this decade."
"With the compact 5.8 inch outer screen, Google has nailed it! Samsung's Z Fold is unwieldy. 1800 bucks is worth it if u plan to use the Pixel Fold for 4-5 years and have proper servicing in ur location...."
"For that price I expect the Tensor G3 making its debut and maybe quad speakers?
The rest of the phone looks fine to me at first glance"
With this design thoughts I would love to have a Pixel flip
I hate the fact that I like it so much! Can't wait for your full review!
"I actually prefer the skinnier front screen of my fold 4. It makes it easier to use one handed and almost feels like an iphone mini + as someone who puts cases on phone, the skinnier ratio of the fold 4 makes it easier to fit in my pocket. I feel like pixel fold with a case on it would feel like a mini book in my pocket."
"If it costed less and actually could beat the Z Fold it would've been different. But now I think it loses. And it's still a first gen product which means it's not gonna be the best thing in many ways. Plus, the Fold 5 is coming in a few months and that's a pretty enhanced device since it's a fifth generation versus a first on Google. And although the Google software will make some people wanna buy this, I don't think it's gonna sell much. But still, it's a pretty good product, it just needs to place itself better (with some improvements or a lower price)."
"People are saying, just wait for V2 or V3. Maybe I will. First generation products do usually suck. And you pay the most for them that might be filled with bugs. Let them refine it a couple more times. 

My biggest concern is if I wait...What if it gets bigger and bigger like the Z Folds? I've read last year that the Oppo Find N3 to be released this year will only get bigger. Oppo may never return to the size of the first two gens."
"I have the galaxy fold 4 and I really like it. But the Screen aspect ratio is somewhat weird both closed and unfolded. Google knows this, and I appreciate the decision they made. I don't care the thick bezel as all foldable has a big black bars on top and the bottom when watching a video especially on YouTube where we all watch a anyway. But with the Price of 1800? I'm gonna hold off."
"I will wait for the z fold 5 and pixel 2. They need the ultra cameras especially considering the s23U destroys the pixel 7's camera setup, and the cpu is dated as well. Bezels don't bother me either with inner displays. Not for 2k though, I will stick with bar phones more than likely unless someone randomly sells me one lol"
"After owning a fold 3 for less than a year and already having screen problems, I am over foldables. The aspect ratio as well for inner screens of folds are terrible for media and gaming. I got a S23 Ultra and love it so much more already."
The good news is Google’s commitment will help drive the form factor to higher levels.
I find it odd that Samsung hasn't sued them for using the same name and a distinct lack of creativity from Google Pixel. Maybe it's flattery but I wouldn't be totally surprised if Google and Samsung were in collaboration over this. They are both pushing the Android platform afterall.
Why do we not mention the “free” watch included with the pre order? In my opinion it is a great bonus. I was thinking about buying the watch in April but decided to wait. Google is giving me $380 for my pixel 7pro 128. So that drops the total price to about $1500 with taxes included. So if you subtract the price of the watch I’m not over paying for this great phone in my opinion plus I’m getting an extra 128 gb I didn’t have before.
"The fold is... Intesting for its price 
But the pixel tablet with the stand is super cool for the good price"
"So for years, we've been told that thick bezels are ""ugly"" and ""low grade"". Suddenly it doesn't really matter, and one wouldn't really notice or be bothered by it. Nice."
Looks darn good. Not going to pay $1800!
"I'm just excited that 

A. They FUNALLY entered the space, so things are going to snowball into far better Foldables across the board"
1800 with no pen support is a bummer for sure. Google never knows what to do right
I like the size of this but I tried the fold 4 because of the weight it seems like the goldilocks is around 240g and this is over that I think like the f4
"If an unlocked fold will work in Canada, I'll buy one."
I love the idea but not paying for anything I will likely break at THAT price. Random note but any chance at sharing that wallpaper. Dig he simple retro colors and seeing as a default on my own pixel.
"Damn it, I want it but It's too pricey for me, and I have to wait to pay off the Fold 4 which is going to be a while and it'll probably be the time when the pixel Fold 2 will be coming out."
"I still prefer the narrower Fold4. You can FIRMLY grip it in one hand folded AND unfolded EVEN WITH a case. When it's folded, you can actually use it one-handed, as your thumb reaches all the way across the screen.
I noticed at 2:40, that your thumb never made it to the left edge of the Pixel screen, so the notion that you'll be able to type more comfortably is likely misplaced. And there is no way you're going to securely grip this thing in one hand, especially when you throw a case on it."
Looks really nice
"My feelings are ""Shut up and take my money."" What I will really be curious about is how well GrapheneOS works on it."
That price is wild otherwise I would have to seriously consider it. At $1800 though? That's iPhone Pro Max territory
"I am disappointed its not coming to more markets around the world (like Australia, but understandable why)"
"I am going to purchase a fold this year, but it will not be this one. I am going with the Fold 5. s-pen support, expect the same style of hinge so it will too fold flat. The UI, Multitasking, the task bar, good lock makes that decision easy."
"With the screen folding so flat, (no gap) is there a risk of damage if something abrasive is between the screens when you close it ? or have they inculded some kind of screen protector."
"That price is STEEP 

Great form factor and software, however the year old chipset likely average battery life and no stylus is a very hard sell. Should under $1500."
"The bezel is not only thick, it also looks cheap which looks like one of those old plastic bezels you can remove from an old laptop screen. Find N2 hardware + pixel software is what we really want."
"The width is great but it's too short and makes the front screen too small, wish they make an xl version"
"If those bezels have speakers, I will be fine with it."
Def want it BUT not at $1800
"From a purely subjective POV, the Pixel Fold easily beats the Fold4 due to its better external display. Having used foldable phones, I know my usage, and I am on the outer show 66% of the time. So Fold4 could have been a better experience for me. Others may like it tall and narrow, but it was annoying for typing, and I use two hands for $1800 devices, so the Samsung fans retort that it is great for one-handed use is moot."
there's also another one this thin that doesn't have such thick bezels.
Great Video  Enjoyed Watching
"So all along you knew how the Pixel Fold looked like all along, huh?"
As a Google fan I love to see this. Price bezels and slow charging I'm going to pass.for now.
With the tensor2 chip and that large screen should get about 2 hours screen time.youd have to charge it after every movie
"Does this have reverse wireless charging? 

I would say that the only ones that are buying this day one are Pixel, Surface Duo, and Z Fold fans. Everyone else will just wait it out for the next few gens or a sale later this year. I'm a Pixel fan but I already got the 7 Pro. I was going to pre-order it today but I'm glad that u didn't. I think I'm gonna wait until the Z Fold 5 to decide which folding phone I'm gonna get. Samsung is gonna put some pressure on Google in a few months forcing them to lower their price. At the same price I will always buy Samsung over Google cause you could do so much more with their phones vs the pixel line."
Have been waiting for this form factor for years and couldn't bring myself to buy the oppo find n so......yeah.. .I'm trading in my galaxy fold 4 and getting this...for sure
"Well, this is the likely replacement for when my Surface Duo 2 reaches its EOL. But it will be a mediocre replacement - at best."
"I like the design choice, but 1800$ is too much, if the price tag would be closer to iphone 14 pro max then it would be a hit for Google."
"Wait a minute , no spen support ? It kills the purpose  of a foldable tablet. $1800 is steep indeed. Samsung does charge something similar but they give more on trade in and the Samsung Zfold4 also has Dex support."
I think it's worth noting the $1800 isn't too crazy with deals. I got a free pixel watch and 10% google store credit ($170) with mine for being a google one subscriber. and $250 for my pixel 6 trade in. so about $650 off.
"$1800 is ridiculous lol
Since the 7a and fold got most of the attention at Google I/O Fi did something very interesting that's going under the radar
Free Pixel 7 with qualifying trade in"
4:15 the multitasking features are basic at best. The Pixel Fold cant do more than 2-app split screen (Galaxy Fold does 3) and it doesnt have pop-up freeform windows (Galaxy Fold does). It doesnt have a fleshed out desktop interface like DeX nor DisplayPort Alt video out - Galaxy Fold does.
At $1800 they need to guarantee more than 3 years of version updates.
I love this ...
"I like it better than the Z Fold, don't like that price tho"
"I just can't figure out why somebody would want a folding phone with a tiny outer screen. A phone you need to unfold to get anything done with most apps. It's why we moved away from flip phones in the first place isn't it? I get the larger formats like Sammy, although it's too narrow, Huawei, Oppo etc, but a 5.8 inch screen feels like a backwards step. Especially considering the interior screen isn't that big with those bezels too."
"Watching this out of respect, I would end up  breaking any  folding phone. If I get some spare change I'll get a used one of ebay to test"
I MUST SAY THEY JUST NAAAILED IT WITH THIS DEVICE
For beta products (like first gen devices) Companies shouldn't chsrge arm and a leg for us (customers) to test their devices. Price should be more affordable
"Expensive yes, but my pre-order is in!"
Another reason someone would care about this: they mainly just care about pixel phones and/or their software experience. I wouldn’t say they have to downprice or do something super crazy to get any attention; they’re the only other phone>tablet foldable in the US market.
Huawei Mate x3 is the fold to go for this year.
You can get the best pixel device and a tablet and probably a watch for that price.
Going to wait for the battery test
If it had a better chip then I would of bought it
"I bet they will really only sell this with their frequent sales. 
Waiting for at least a drop to 1k before I start preparing my wallet."
Pre-ordered mine...been waiting 2 yrs for this
I’ll wait for Apple to come out with their version by 2040
Well I pre-ordered mine from google when I considered I get a free Google watch which is a $349. It makes the price of the fold not too bad.
All the pixel fold ui features will be coming to the fold 4 with one ui 6.0
Here I am wishing they would bring back micro sd storage for these kinds of phones.
"I still don't understand why they just don't make folding phones bigger think 2 s23 ultras big one side battery other side components,  the hole point of a folding phone is that big screen experience in a small package . They need a plus model."
"At this price all these foldables should include the charger a case and wireless earbuds does not have to be the latest. I think its too late for the device, in a couple of months we get Samsungs flip & Fold, Apple devices and their own Pixel 8."
"No desktop mode or chrome mode no deal for the price, would have to be a phone, table and laptop (into monitor) replacement."
Awesome first look
"My 2023 Smartphone Wishlist
1. Google Pixel Fold
2. Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"
"It is a first-generation product, but it does not have first-generation hardware. Samsung and others were hard at work making this form factor work."
"The problem with pixels is that they always impress at first look, but the honeymoon period is struck down by half baked hardware or software or crappy support."
"Google really bombed on the price. 1400-1500 dollars - I would definitely purchase one. 1800 - that is too much for my liking. Too bad, Google could have given Z Fold a serious competition."
I think Google took a step back on the inner display design with the bezels.. it reminds me of the old portable DVD players or the old flat screen TV with the bezels.. I will stick with Samsung or go with the Xiamoi Mix fold 3..
That form factor is FAR better than the Z Fold 5. I’d buy this over the Fold 5 in a heartbeat.
"I actually want one but I'm not getting it because for that price I can get a computer, which I honestly need for university more than this foldable."
"If Surface Duo and Find N2 had a baby...
iPhone 13 mini: 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.7 mm
Find N: 132.6 x 73 x 15.9 mm
Find N2: 132.2 x 72.6 x 14.6 mm"
"Samsung has a more aggressive trade-in program. This makes it appear cheaper and more affordable. Google wants $2000 upfront and will only refund you after they receive the trade in. Samsung does not do that. Google will discount this phone quickly, especially with the galaxy z fold 5 releasing soon."
I wished it had a bigger battery... im worried with the bigger screen and G2 chip itll burn through battery...
"The Pixel Fold's external display is too wide, even wider than the Pixel 7 Pro, but people want to convince us it's convenient for one-handed use ️

They tell us that the internal screen of the Pixel is exceptional but forget to mention that you just have to rotate 90° the Fold 4 to have the same display ratio."
like it... i'm amazed how people trash it and have never even touched it. lets give it a chance. And this is probably the 1st device that they didnt boch as a new entry product.
"Pixel 7 Pro has 6.7 in screen, 5000 mah battery, Tensor 2 and 12GB RAM, and it has average battery life (at best). Pixel Fold has 7.6 in screen, additional screen up front, smaller battery (4800 mah), same Tensor 2 from last year and same RAM. There's no magical scenario where Fold has anything even close to a decent battery life. And on top of that, it starts at $1800...Train wreck in the making."
"If you have to choose between the s23 ultra and this, which one you take?"
It is awesome but cannot buy it here in Australia!
The black version does make it look better.
"And i am sure they told him not to show from side when open since it doesnt open completely flat, the fold 5 will be better in everyway and samaung will give great trade in deals also, google has a chance to convince us to switch but refuses to give great trade in options for this pixel, oh you get a free crap watch when they plan to release a new one here soon"
"We need the Fold to become as wide as this while staying as tall. Samsung, how long is it gona take???"
Those bezels are YUGE
"Does it have a wired dex alternative, please?"
"Face it, the inner screen on Google's $1800 Pixel Fold already looks dated, especially compared to other, cheaper Folds. Plus, with the Z Fold 5 getting released soon this is about to be another Pixel that doesn't sell."
I fold my arms waiting eagerly for the review but then the price tag made me fold my eyes.
Anyone else wonder why we don’t get under display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on any foldable ?
"The problem is -- its a massive device like all folds.  The market for a big, dual screen, foldable phone is very limited.  When I want a phone, I use my phone.  When I go to bed, I pull out my iPad..."
"It's impressive, but that price tag is a big NO! I hear coming from my wallet."
"As someone who's not a fan of both Samsung and Chinese brands, this will be the first foldable I'm seriously considering."
At 1800 dollars i rather get a samsung fold 5 when it comes out. I just dont trust them with new devices anymore. I will defenitely give them a shot 3 to 4 years from now.
$1800 is gonna make this D.O.A. for a lot of people... Including me
I am interested but only when it goes on a serious sale
Will wait for pixel fold 2. I never buy 1st gen Google products anymore
The only salvation for me would be the trade in program
"I like the form factor better. But, no on the price  $$$$$$$$ too expensive"
Doesn't look bad
"Yeah honey we have some chinese folding phone in europe like huawei mate x3, but man it costs 1/3 more than Z Fold4."
I pre-ordered mine already.  Free LTE Pixel Watch and all.
"Samsung, take notes of the form factor."
1800 USD for these bezels
Is there anyone here that actually prefer Samsung's implementation of the skinny profile? I think I do but I dont know for sure because I'm waiting for my galaxy fold 4.
You can try to sugar coat it all you want but that's a hard NO! On that phone or Any foldable phone for that matter.  And yes I have owned one.
Love to have it but just too much money.
Does anyone know if they're doing $1000 tradeins like samsung does?
I’m always the person saying everything new is the same or junk then a month later I’m using it
Since my Pixel 7 bricked after 6 months...........it seems tempting but unsafe.
"$1800 is really high, any person who buys this full price is going to get screwed in a few months when they slash prices. I can see $1500-$1600 in like a month or two."
"Compare to all the foldables we have out, this phone already look outdated with that bezels. Also why make a bezel that thick and not put a front firing speakers in it.  Can any of the Google Bootlickers please explain or help me understand."
"Other than the price ..... I can bet the battery life will be poor, with tensor G2.  (I am using  pixel 7 pro , battery  life sucks on it) If you have watched the Google I/O , fold was connected to the charger all the time during the presentation."
This could rival what Samsung's Z FOLD 4. It folds flat and I'm digging the design. It's like a phablet but not really; a tablet
"id like to buy but its too expensive and from where i’m from, we’ll have to import from another country and has no support locally.. with that price tag ill stick with my phone and get a tablet instead."
"1:17
Bro really spoke in tongues for a split second and thought we wouldn't notice"
Not coming to Australia. Glad it isn't. The fold 5 will be way better.
Being that google make android I new they would make a better fold because of software. But the price is too goddamn high.
Sure I’ll buy it if it was sold for maybe $1299
"Good review but those bezels and slow wireless charging and 1799.00 price   ,The galaxy fold 4 has all the bugs out"
This is what apple should focus on instead of a VR headset.
"Until the Galaxy Fold 5, this summer. Anyway still way too pricey for a smartphone/small tablet."
The outer screen is a scratch magnet.
"$1,499 would have been a better price"
Where can I find the wallpaper?
Bezels are genius? You can tell which YouTubers Google paid to come check it out
"Samsung's design of the fold has kept me at bay in buying their devices. I have wanted to, being a galaxy customer for many years.  Until they address that narrow outer display, i will not buy Samsung foldables!"
That's a surface Duo hinge if I ever saw one... this whole phone is a surface Duo with a folding screen...
They beat Apple to the foldable phone race
You know damn well I rather go for a Samsung z fold 5 especially being from Samsung and the price
I want one
Google are not the best with 1st Generation products my pixel 6 pro wasn't great at first so ill wait and see
I think this is another one that is consigned to the Google graveyard.
"Idk, Google Fi is offering the Samsung fold 4 for ~$1000 without a trade in. For comparable features plus the maturity of a 4th gen platform AND nearly half the cost? No brainer.

Also, Google has a bad history with pixel problems upon rollout. The pixel 2, pixel 4, pixel 6..."
$1200-1400 suits it more
"I have the Z fold 4 and I just ordered the Pixel fold. 
Why?
Because of stock Android. Pixel OS is the equivalent to or do I dare to say even better than Apple OS and I've been a ranboy of apple since the 1st iphone"
1499 and I would think about it.
"I went in on it. They toss a pixel watch, wifi or lte option, so might as well take the LTE variant. I'm excited."
Googled to support phones with OS support at least 5 full update to get me.
I like the form factor better in pixel than samsung
Needs a stylus!
£1800 tho. I don't care how good it is.
"for now, the biggest google unsolved flaw might be samsung 4nm chip, the chip basically BS compare to TSMC 4nm."
Price to damn high for the 1st Gen period
"1. Those Thick Bezel
2. $1.800??
You gotta be kidding us.."
Don't like the bezels and outside display looks too wide to hold
"Before buying google pixel, make sure your country is included in Google country list supported by 5G."
"Jaime says its the best first gebn product he tested, but twitter giants want to complain about bezels....."
The price will be its downfall.
You can buy an amazing TV and s23 ultra for that Price
""
I just don't see how the battery life is going to be good with that G2 chip when it has a smaller battery than the pixel 7 pro with an extra screen and that phone's battery life isn't good. Also software wise it doesn't bring anything new to the table vs the galaxy fold and lacks stylus support. It's agood first attempt but they should have priced it lower with fold 5 just 2 months away from release.
"dude, those bezels... 
how can that be acceptable ?"
That beat though
"To sleep for my budget however.  If I trade in my iPhone 12 Max. It’s 800 off plus you get free pixel watch. That one thing about google , the promos"
Best phone on a failed form factor is still a failure of a phone.
i'd be All over it at $1199-ish.  $1799 is a big Nope. But I am buying the new google tablet at $499
The z fold 4 is cheaper and better specs wise
Never buy the 1st gen of ANY tech. Maybe I will consider this next year.
that thick bezel make it looks like a toyish…
thumbs up for the thumbnail xD
"The price is just unjustifiable. The hardware lacks basic features and the software is absolutely horrendous (and also featureless).

The form factor is better than Samsung's Fold, but still inferior to the Find N2."
"No. Even if I get a free watch thatight not synch with the phone for alarms, dnd etc..."
"no offense, but Google Pixel phone is not my choice of phone, because it may be a Samsung Galaxy z z 5 camera but not with software"
Preorder and get a Google watch for free.
1799 HELL NO. I was so looking forward to it but NO WAY i'm spending 2k on a phone
"Pretty sure this is made in China as well, which is a positive."
$1800. Nah bro.
tell me it has the dock implemented in Android 12L because I don't see it here
"1:17 WTF was that, like he stepped in another portal"
In that price in that mediocre spec/performance and camera is overpriced.. and its 1st gen means many unseen bugs and defect coming.. not worth the money at least now
Inside with  those big bezels its looking bad.
well first i think its gonna be a amazing phone goole phones are amazing i love samsung phones they're the best in the world  and ihave been loving the foldable phones since samsung released is in 2019. im not ever gonna back to a regular phone the only phone that will be better then the foldable phones is the samsung rollable phones thats the phone im super stoked about and thats the same feeling i had when i got my first foldable phone. now for you to say this is the best first gen product of foldable is not great samsung has been doing this since 2019 be4 anyone else imagine if google would've made a foldable phone in 2019 it would've been nowhere near this pixel fold so for you too say that is down playing what samsung did when they was the first to bring thr foldable out in 2019
Looks like a prototype to me with its thicc bezels and gaps between the hinges. $1800 price lololololololololololololol
"People need to stop pushing the narrative that the Fold 4 cameras aren't great, because they are."
"No, Google. This isn't it."
"These embargo’s.. every tech tuber gushing over this bezel of a phone. To pricey, 2 generations behind, and saying it’s the best phone isn’t saying much.

All flagships too pricey, and the folds are no exception. They twice the price they need to be. Flagships need to be well under 1k, prob near 700 . These phones are just pure profit and gold for companies"
"$1500 
Would be better"
1800 is aggressive to you?
"The whole problem is the old fashioned design, huge bezels......
Still far to small, it should have been made taller....
Battery to small...
Price is ridiculously...."
I Feel sad for people who buy this pixel fold with exynoss tensor processor  and beezel of fold 1 by samsung  andddd price is 1800$ . Fluff off google
"It's not special enough for $1,799... Excuse me 1929 that's tax included. I was hoping that this would not be the pixel 7 pro just in a different form factor. That's just not good enough. It needs to have extra features that my current pixel doesn't have. It needs to be able to do something that even the Samsung foldable cannot do. Very disappointed."
ngl the bezel is a huge turn off
For the price no it's not that impressive
James how dare you Nexus 4 is the best Google phone hands down mic drop nuff said
$1800
Price oh the price
Front screen is perfect inside sucks not samd
I ain't gone lie boa the first video it seem like Google payed somebody cuz this phone is a FAIL if it was priced at maybe 1099  it could be appealing but for 1800 just get the better foldable ..... Samsung
"I really don't care about this phone at all, specially if I have to pay $1.8k for it."
Compare to huawei mate x3 not even close..
I’m so over “shorts”
Nah google smoking that potent fentanyl
Not beta testing at $1800. No thank you.
It’s not coming to Australia and I’m pi$$ed
"No, I’m not gonna care because for that money Fold 5 will kill it. IMHO, for that price Pixel Fold is DOA"
It’s still something I’m not interested in
Hmmm...buy a  or a $2000 book
"£1800 sorry, no thanks!"
"Just say,you wouldn't buy it, and you don't recommend it. Why, elongate your response,way too much. Time is not good,for a ridiculously high priced option like this now with inflation and the many  wars going on."
"no foldable is worth the the price its a bad gimmick, better buy tablet,if i wanna have larger screen
until these phones drop the price they are overpriced"
1800 lol ya no..
reminds me of microsoft dual screen thing... looks terrible. I'll wait for 3rd gen.
Why can’t we have phones that fold both ways?
Do yourself a favour and skip it ...always skip first gen.
You just hate Google
id rather have a google foldable flip phone
It's really ugly when you open it.. its bad
"No expandable memory, no headphone jack and at a $1700 price point? Pass. There has not been a phone made that gives you the value since the galaxy note 9. None."
Is ugly and have a cres old processor  the bezel looks like and old phone + 1800 good lock to the buyers.
All you did was complain
THIS is the worst fold phone ever made...
"NEVER going to buy it at that price. Too many compromises; small battery, downgraded cameras, questionable durability, no stylus support etc"
dibs lol
First
First
It's ugly
Kids today don’t remember how cool it was to be able to flip a phone open
"Clear calling is awfully underrated.
Just last week, me and my brother were at a  concert. Both of us have pixel phones. Every time we got separated and wanted to find one another we would make a call. Even next to the stage we could hear each other's voice clearly with virtually no background noise from the blasting music."
I gotta say the fold they got looks impressive. They really flattened it out.
"Arun makes videos so much more fun to watch even if it's virtually the same content as others.I literally watched 2-3 other videos explaining all the same things, but his was by far the most entertaining"
"Great review, like the new filming locations instead of just using the room. It´s really nice to see someone being this creative"
"I'm curious about the reason behind discontinuing the review of Huawei phones. Recently, I came across the P60 Pro model and was truly impressed by its capabilities. As a former iOS user who switched to the P30 Pro for three years before returning to iPhone due to the absence of Google services, I find it remarkable that Huawei manages to excel in photography and develop EMUI without Google's assistance, considering they are restricted from utilizing the latest technologies. It leaves me wondering how much further they could have progressed if they hadn't faced these restrictions. The level of achievement despite the challenges is truly unimaginable."
"""I think she is checking out his hardware"" Yo arun"
"As a Fold 4 user, I'm so glad Google is pushing the industry forward, this may encourage more companies to do Foldables. Samsung has done an excellent work til now, but a lot of features are still exclusive for us, while the competition is still years behind. This might change soon. Competition is always good for customers."
"I do appreciate the fact that Arun is trying out new backdrops for each video, but on the other hand, I could see Arun in pale light in several instances in this video as compared to the brightly lit studio he usually films in. Also, I adore the fact that he polishes the corners before uploading a video. Love that."
"Man, I have been dying to get a foldable phone recently but thought it would be a mistake to go with the Samsung Fold 4. I'm going to wait for the Samsung Fold 5 to release and then probably decide between this phone and the Fold 5. The software being so incredible on this phone may push me to go this route. Need to see exactly what the Fold 5 can offer though."
"Ah yes, I love thick bezels in 2023. Despite that, I'm glad Samsung is finally getting some real competitions in the foldable space. This will push them and everyone else to make better products"
I love watching these videos as a person who's had the same Galixy s10e with a huge black chunk and rgb lights covering 15% of the screen since the phone came out. It really highlights the luxuries I could be enjoying but cant because I have no money
"The one thing I'll say about the bezzles is that for people who have longer nails that might be pretty nice, since fingernails can danage the inner screen if you push too hard. They give you a space to use to close the phone that wont get damaged"
"I would argue that you don't need any dedicated selfie cameras.  This form factor allows you to use the rear high end cameras with the large outer screen to take better selfies than any inner camera could.  So ditch the 2 selfie cameras, lose the bezels, drop the price and make more room for battery capacity"
this guy puts so much effort in to his videos mad respect
"Througout the years my perception of foldables kinda changed. When  the Galaxy fold came out, I thought that I'd never buy one as I've seen it kinda impractical. But as the tech progressed and more and more companies make them now, I kind of want one. 
The Pixel Fold seems like a nice one too."
"Loved the new set!
The refreshing natural beauty is far better than any studios ngl"
"Having been using the Fold4 I have to say one of the best things is the narrower screen when folded. Makes it much easier to use one handed and if I need a wider screen, hey just unfold the phone.  Though I do like the look of the pixel fold over all (aside from the stupid bezel camera)."
"The bezels allow the hinge mechanisms to sit mainly above and below the inner display, instead of behind. This allows it to fold totally flat where the Fold 4 can't. Fair trade off IMO but I'm surprised you didn't catch that."
The Pixel Fold is going to be a productivity monster! Imagine being able to use this for business with all the new AI features. Spec hunting isnt my thing at all so I would am board with the Pixel Fold. Im really excited about this. I expect a Fold to be expensive so the $1800 price tag is not a surprise at all.
"As a samsung fold user, i think this is a really interesting competition! And as is always said, competition breeds innovation. Here's hoping future smartphones are improved by it!

Few things to note:"
Im surprised so many people still dont like bezels. They are very practical. I feel like companies have tried to hard to get rid of them.
Solid review. My 2 cents on front facing cameras. I only use them for video messaging. So 3mp (1080p ish) is sufficient. All I care about is color fidelity and dynamic range. Also focusing is nice as well (lots are fixed focus these days with the hole cut cameras requiring small space not sufficient for focus mechanisms)
The phone seems like a good start for Google into the fold series but there's still a very long way to go.
Totally agree about the bezels! I've got the ZF4 and my biggest pro is the large screen so to see such large bezels is a bit
"Arun i just wanted to say, completely unrelated to this video but your recent lifestyle transformation videos that you made really helped me to take a step back and alter some apsects of my own lifestyle. I'm now at a point after consistently working on it that i can say thank you for the motivation, my life has genuinely changed for the better and I would've never thought to take a look at myself without watching your videos. Big love and appreciation, keep up the hard work"
"This Titan M2 is exactly what Samsung has with the Knox chip, for many years now, and apple too. I love seeing more companies investing in security. Feels like all other androids don't really invest in it and think security as a non-important thing... competition is very important, Google is the first non-mainstream brand to have a dedicated security chip."
this looks AWESOME and it could set a new standard for fold phones!
its interesting to see a video with a little less editing (likely due to hands on time and a quick upload) - still super engaging. the best tech channel on the platform. great work arun!
"I like the shape of the pixel fold over the Galaxy fold 4 (wider > taller front screen imo) but can't help but feel it's hardware is going to be out of date really fast even by phone standards and that price is really bad. 

Hopefully the 2nd version gets more appropriate hardware when it releases. I do want to get a folding phone when my S22 ultra's contract runs out :)"
"The camera shots in this video is really cool, I love the scenery choice in the background. Appreciate the work"
"I like those bezels, gives you something to hold onto without it pressing things on the screen. I even have issues with this on the S22 Ultra sides."
"Arun, I have been watching you since 2018, when you had the racing chair. Ever since the n me and my family have loved and cherished your videos, passing on lots of useful tech knowledge. I have especially enjoyed your tech fails series. I want you to take this as a thank you, some love from one of your loyal supporters and I hope you live a long and happy life, giving us more tech knowledge as you go. Thank you so much."
I quite like the bezels like that. It feels like it's adding some protection to the screen yet also looks 'old skool'. The only thing that I see as being ugly is the damn price.
Great review of the Google Pixel Fold! Your balanced perspective is truly valuable for consumers. Excited for more honest and informative content like this!
"This is why Arun is always creative and amazing, nobody has ever made a video where two people are checking two different hardware's at the same time in one video."
I tried the Z flip and fold 4 at a rogers store and I loved it! So satisfying to open and see the app expand. Foldables were never and option for me. My dad works with dust in the garage and there's a lot of dust at our trailer park.
"I don’t like creases, so I won’t get a foldable until they make it completely unnoticeable, but I think the bezels actually look good on this thing."
"These videos always make my day instantly better, thank you Arun"
About battery life and animations. You can increase the juice time when you force dissable the animations. Sadly in material you some features are hardcoded to only work with some animations. For example dual screen. If you dissable the animations the app can't swoop to the top and you can not choose a second Apps to use in the lower half at the same time.
Love your videos! I always learn so much from them! I also love how high quality they are!
"The bezels are also thicker at the top and bottom because of how they designed the hinge. The screen has to fit between the top and bottom hinge components because Google decided to put the majority of the hinge hardware at the top and bottom instead of all along the spine behind the screen. It's similar to what Microsoft did with the Duo hinge except with a single screen instead of 2 screens. There is still hinge hardware running down the spine, but the majority has been moved to the top and bottom. Google says this is what allows the phone to fold completely flat."
"I love your vids, you are so creative and I have been watching your great content for so long, Thank you for being amazing!"
A step in the right direction but I hate the bezels. I've gotten so used to screen bezels getting thinner and thinner just to go back to 2015. The screen ratio looks very promising tho.
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
"I liked how the main screen is big, something we struggle with in Samsung fold4. I'm not sure if I will be into the Pixel software but let's give it a try"
Apparently the bezel thickness is primarily caused to the hinge mechanism they designed (those things at the very center you see it above and below the screen).
"I would love to try this phone out! 
It look awesome!"
i like the bezels honestly i think its more convenient to hold it too
This amazing for their first go! I'll wait for the second one too see what Google  can do!
"I think it's better to have a slight gap when having a closed phone. If you were to close a phone that doesn't have a gap with a small rock or sand in the middle, it could damage the screen was your closing it. I think that's the primary reason why Samsung went for the U style closing screen instead of the waterdrop closing screen even though they have a patent for both,"
A google / samsung collab for a foldable would be wild
"I'll get one when they get down to the 100$ mark. I think this is the best foldable yet, but I'm not willing to go to 180$ for a phone. My company will get me a 100$ phone - I just got a Pixel 7 Pro - and I always have a decent private tablett (>500$) but I can't combine the money otherwise I'd be buying it so for those with everything from the same account I can see this being tantalizing."
0:51 Turning Software into hardware
"""We need to talk about the bezel in the room"" had me rolling.
The phone has bezels that are big enough to be confused with an elephant"
The bezels are outrageous absolutely killed it for me.
"I love the Google phone, and the foldable design provides everything I need. However, this is just the first one; watch out for the Fold 2."
I am intrigued by this device especially for work options.  I love my P7.  And the bezel does not bither me at all.
Great to see you back at what you are good at: information dense yet clear reviews. Prefer those over the 'top 50 things ... '.
I love the design of this it is like it knows what it wants to be but it still feels experimental
the production value of these videos have been getting better and better lately. nice arun
Thank you for spending so much time and money on what you do for us.
"I love Arun, he makes the best videos!! I remember when the flip phones were just released, it was like it was the coolest thing in the world..."
Extremely high quality review!  Respect!
"The year began and something is already making it better than the entire 2022. Amazons AWM23K came out and it's such a great thing no matter where you come from. Everyone can participate and it is making many things easier than they have been. For example I live in France and this is something no one else could do for me here, if I just keep sitting on my toes for the next 5 years I'd simply go broke, now I can change that."
Great review. Honest content - as always.
Most phones are more than capable of differentiating your voice from the background. The largest problem for a clear sound is the phone line itself. Sometimes you have a very clear call and it sounds as if the person stands right next to you but then the quality suddenly drops and you get this typical 19 hundredth appeal.
"We need more competition in folding , especially in software flavours"
I JUST always love your analysis behind every phone you reviewed in the channel !!!!
"I am looking forward to the fold. Tensor working with Android is naturally a great combo. The Price give you pause,"
I think that would be the best folding phone (maybe Apple can make one too?)
The thing about the pixel phones that bothers me the most is the battery charging and size. I'm a bit spoiled with a 120 watt Charing phone but even a 60 watt should be doable for the same price.
Really wouldn't be a bad idea to compare it to the Huawei Mate X3 foldable.
"I pre-ordered the Pixel Fold, since I am still using an old Samsung Fold3.  With the pre-order + a free watch and a trade in of my Fold3, came out to $999.  I thought it was worth it."
Man i love this guy. i also love the way he does reviews.
"Loved those beautiful nature backgrounds throughout the video great video as always, Arun"
This video quality is insanely clear and... indescribable
Honestly I’m very fine with the bezels I sort of like how it looks
"After seeing google pixel products. Hands down I think the next smart phone I'm gonna upgrade to is gonna be Pixel. I just really love the software, it looks warm and lively."
Your videos are very informative and amazing
I was set to get one of these… that price tag just murdered that ambition
"Hopefully there will be updates, and the phone will be better. Its still pretty awesome though.
The recorder transcript is for all pixels with the newest update, I have a pixel 6 and I have it"
"What a crazy time, we had all this bad stuff going around and now Amazons AWM23K finally shows what happens when you do something smart with your life. Sounds crazy I know but this is actually the first time I was really, really happy since the whole covid thing started"
Your videos are awesome!Always useful
Crazy how time flies so fast. From saying how foldables are so futuristic  to now foldares have been for 4 years  now
"2:29 ""I think she's checking out his hardware"" .... that's not something u expect to hear in a foldable review"
"Thank you for the What-would-be-if-it-be. I suppose Google will deliver, no sweat about it, but the price is darn $$$$. It would be nice to have your impressions on Oppo Find N2."
"Also... the main screen has a larger width, which for me is great to use in portrait mode, instead of the 1:2 super-slim (in width) front screens in some foldables..."
"I like the google pixel 7 pro. Not as much as iphones but its still fun to play with. 

Not gonna get this, but its actually a nice device. Really hoping to see a foldable iphone in a bit"
"The way he changed background throughout the video is so amazing️
Also another great review as always."
I love how arun changes the set from his studio to a castle and now to a park. It felt very lively during this video to see all of the greenery
"You always make my day, and make me smarter! Thanks Arun!"
"I'm so glad you mentioned those thick borders. In my opinion, unforgivable! Beautiful OS though"
"I used to assume having a tablet with extremely thin bezels would be a great thing. Well, I now have one. It's terrible to hold lazily with one hand while laying on my side. Even with my thin hands, my palm still touches the screen from time to time, causing accidental touches. It's so frustrating. I had to download an app that disables touch, that I have to keep turning on and off. (Apps that disable edge touches didn't work for my tablet). I'm now someone who sees the practicality in larger bezels."
Nice to see reviews outside your room and house. Some scenery like this with your reviews are excellent.
"Thank you for the thorough ""hands on."" As I suspected, Googles choice in skimping on hardware will make it easy to wait for their price drop once the Z Fold 5 goes on sale."
Already can't wait for the next year's Pixel fold 2
"living in China, and having had an Oppo Find N for over a year - was intrigued to see what Google would do with a very similar fim factor foldable. Does look OK - but not an extra £400ish investment"
Keep up the good work I love the content
"I really love watching these since 2017 even though I can't afford them, thank Arun."
"I'll stick with the z fold line, Googles first folding phone will come with alot of issues pluses huge as bezels. Maybe next year Google."
rocking the fold 4 for almost  a year now. only thing I'd change is the cover screen needs to be wider. definitely would not invest in google's 1st run in foldable
"Had a chuckle when Arun said ""she is checking out his hardware"" wasn't expecting that couple to pull that lol"
Love your work bro keep it going ️
Hell yeah we get a sneak peek!! Been wanting to see it in the flesh for so long
This is dope.  I would say i like it more than the Samsung fold but never owned one.  Really hoping i can get my husband one of these .
"I kinda love the bezels, feels like I'm using a old tablet/ebook."
The fact he can rickroll us in every video is insane lol
Props for not pulling any punches despite having very exclusive early access.
"This is a good first step, but it's not worth paying out 2K. Google should have offered a better trade in value or the Pixel 7 pro so that more people to pick adopt the foldable. my other issue with the foldable is that Google should have taken the time to make a stylus to pair with it for more usefulness."
The effort levels are amazing keep it it up!
Hi ive been watching you for years i love your video they helped me get through my lowest of lows thank boss
"The quality is superp as always 
Lets just appreciate Aruns consistensy"
Now could this be at least a runner up in this year's mrwhosetheboss phone awards for the foldable category?
"or at the very same event, you could get a nice phone for your pocket and a big screen to put in your bag for nearly half the price! the 7a and the tablet are under 500 dollars each."
"Great review, at this price point it needs to be perfect and the bezel is a deal breaker.  Still, augers well for the Pixel Fold 2 next year for all the other reasons you pointed out."
I can see arun is trying alot of new things and it really is towards a direction pre planned
Now it’s apple’s turn to make foldables
"I’d like to try this out. I don’t think I’d like that enough to choose it over the safe option of an iPhone 15 Pro Max that will work with my watch and airpods properly, for half again the price"
4:39 this just shows that we've gotten so used to phones with big screens that a little bit of bezel would drive us crazy I honestly don't care about the bezels I'm used to it
Idk i went for it. Even if the price is over board i think this the leap we need it.  Samsung need it some competition and also this helps improve apps to work with foldables and even tablets at this point.
"For anyone who watches tech videos, this channel makes the best tech videos ever imaginable.

Edit: Ain’t no way Mrwhosetheboss actually liked my comment, I’m freaking out like dayumm."
Well thank you for another well done honest first impression.
Can you please make side by side comparisons of all foldable phones just to get better understanding which one to get
"I’m in Apple’s ecosystem, if Apple won’t step up their game with iPhone 15 pro this year I might switch over to Google. Apple’s last few phone releases were boring, they had nothing really going for them, they were mainly showing off features that other phones already have plus some that are locked to US and/or really unnecessary unless you’re expecting to crash your car in the middle of nowhere. Siri is also years behind google assistant."
At one point I thought Arun is thinking of changing his content from tech to something else highly rated
I’ll stick with my zf2 till we see a next gen fold come out. Awsome video
"Z fold 4 won again. This looks like mini surface duo with another screen. Not only the inner bezels are ugly, it increases the chance of damaging display with dust particles when closed. And that aspect ratio makes it uncomfortable to hold for one handed use. If you're making phone think (folded), make it easy to hold by narrowing the phone."
The aspect ratio is really niceon the outside display I want that but then non foldable just the outer screen phone
"After all these years, Arun or his editor will always be cheeky lil’ bastards"
"2:33 ""I think she's checking out his hardware"""
"The bezel is GREAT. I can hold it. It looks great. 

Google needs to create a dex competitor and the Pixel Fold would replace all my devices."
"Now imagine the google pixel battery life both on two screens, amazing!...."
Nice review. Pixel is leveling up.
"for 1800, i d expect a perfect and crease-free phone. Cant wait to see how many bugs that pixel fold have to fix."
Love your work. ️
"If the screen is the same as the Plus models when folded, i might consider"
"The bezels do kill it for me, I couldn't pick it over the newest Samsung fold"
"It's looking pretty good, I know Google's got developers  that are going to create some custom ROM'S for this phone, and it's going to have features because of it that no other phone has already, and then with the custom ROM it's just going to kick the rest of the phone companies right in the ass, and this is their first generation of a fold phone and it's still going to kick the rest in the ass, it's looking pretty good."
"I had no idea what the pixel fold looked like before this video, and as soon as I saw the phone, the first thing I noticed were the bezels"
Massive respect bro
Google has a good team behind them. Yet another good phone. I will be getting this and Iphone 15 this year
"Oh!! The inner bezels makes this look like an old PDA back from 1997!!! And the cost £17,49 here on the UK… you can get an iPhone, an iPad and Apple Watch for that price!!"
Google launched some very useful features this time .
I don't think bezels aren't a bad thing... give you space to hold it and the screen is still big...
"I like the bezel around pixel fold,it is more charming.when Samsung launched their first foldable, the price was 2000 dollars."
Google made a good concept device with the Fold. It’s like a reference design for rest of the Android space on how to make a foldable.
"Gonna have to wait for the second gen to drop. The front display is perfect aspect ratio for me, don't really like the really narrow and tall Samsung fold, but them bezels just look olddd..."
"Quite a solid build but still got behemoth bezels ( a deal breaker ! )Next time ,I think they should strive to reduces them to the bare minimum."
It feels like Arun is the only person in this world who introducing new gadgets first
GrapheneOS support right out the box.. I think that this may very well be my next phone. I honestly wouldn't buy any phone that isn't a Pixel.
"The battery problem is that people like me want all day battery with all its bells and whistles, not more than 24 hours if you use extreme battery saver cuz you can get a new ancient flip phone that works like that and will last all day so it's not impressive until you can be quad HD + and everything on all day"
8:38 Even this phone has more optical telephoto zoom than an iPhone (for now)
"Hi Arun, I was planning to gift my mom a phone. I was considering between the s23, s22, pixel 7, and the iPhone 14. Would be lovely if you can give your feedback. What she needs is good camera and proper amount of storage. Right now she uses a very basic smartphone, so anything of that tier will be high level for her, so want to choose something which will be easier for her to use and have a smoother learning curve."
"To me, these foldables are good “home” phones. 
I would not want to transport them around from place to place. 
But that’s just me."
"The bezel does make sense, it adds a layer of protection when closed, it gives it a better aspect ratio, and when you start to get closer to ipad size, you need a bezel to hold the device with your fingers, since your hand no longer wraps around it."
I love every video you make! Keep Going with what you do!
"Hi Arun, I really love the change of scenery in this new style of videography you are adopting. I can't help but stick to the end of the video"
My regular non-folding Pixel 7 Pro is so riddled with software and hardware bugs that i am not even going to begin to imagine how many bugs they are going to try and pack into their debuting folding phone
"Loved the new set!

The refreshing natural beauty is far better than any studios ngl"
This man never fails to disappoint us with a single video. he is the perfect match of information comedy and entertainment. If i ever recommend a tech channel it's this guy. And soon he might overtake apple. Respect.
I gotta say the fold they got looks impressive. They really flattened it out.
I love how Arun took something most people would avoid in their artistic process and just worked with it
"The one thing I'll say about the bezzles is that for people who have longer nails that might be pretty nice, since fingernails can danage the inner screen if you push too hard. They give you a space to use to close the phone that wont get damaged"
"Great review, like the new filming locations instead of just using the room. It´s really nice to see someone being this creative"
The Pixel Fold is going to be a productivity monster! Imagine being able to use this for business with all the new AI features. Spec hunting isnt my thing at all so I would am board with the Pixel Fold. Im really excited about this. I expect a Fold to be expensive so the $1800 price tag is not a surprise at all.
Thank you for spending so much time and money on what you do for us.
this looks AWESOME and it could set a new standard for fold phones!
"I don't know why but the Pixel Fold is getting me more excited than when Samsung released their first foldable; and I was excited for that. $1800 is still a tough pill to swallow, but it seems like this form factor, wider than Samsung's narrower screens, seems to ideal for foldable phones; excluding flip phones."
Your videos are very informative and amazing
"These videos always make my day instantly better, thank you Arun"
i like the bezels honestly i think its more convenient to hold it too
A step in the right direction but I hate the bezels. I've gotten so used to screen bezels getting thinner and thinner just to go back to 2015. The screen ratio looks very promising tho.
Great review of the Google Pixel Fold! Your balanced perspective is truly valuable for consumers. Excited for more honest and informative content like this!
I love the design of this it is like it knows what it wants to be but it still feels experimental
"Througout the years my perception of foldables kinda changed. When  the Galaxy fold came out, I thought that I'd never buy one as I've seen it kinda impractical. But as the tech progressed and more and more companies make them now, I kind of want one. 

The Pixel Fold seems like a nice one too."

i think the main disappointment people are feeling is the price. it was hyped up for months by youtubers and articles to be 1k
A price tag of $1200 would have made this a great offering.
Who just loves Arun’s consistent content??
this was a great video!! thanks for sharing i really enjoyed it.
The outer main display and the capable camera setup look great as compared to other foldable in the market.
"If panels can close completely (without any gap, like in Samsung), I believe that hard particles (even sand crystals) may easily scratch/dent the screen. Indeed I do believe that is the reason for Samsung's engineers choice."
"As a galaxy fold 4 user i can totally agree with dust/dirt entering the hinge , can make a nice crunch"
4:39 The bezels wont bother me. I think its a plus since i wont have as much undesired touch input on the screen.
"I love this phone, I can’t wait for the 3rd iteration"
Oppo find n2 looks complete in term of aesthetic and design. It's the perfect fold yet.
Honestly love how entertaining and truthful arun always is. Never have been disappointed by a video from him. Keep up the good work
"It's not always about his hardware, it's more about the software after all it's a Pixel"
"I really want a foldable, but I've decided I won't get one until Applethinks the technology is good enough to put their name on one. When Apple releases their first one and sets the new standard, then I'll get whatever Android generation comes out after that."
Loved the video. So informative
It looks more holdable than other foldables.
"Interesting, that pixel has finally launched a foldable phone!"
"""I think she's checking out his hardware"" lol"
Really great backdrops photographically and esthetically.
they had the perfect opportunity to check the zooming capabilities
Arun will never disappoint you
Thank you for spending so much time and money on what you do for us
There is still room for improvements in these foldable devices. We are just not ready for them.
"1:08 ""I can't tell you how many times I've opened up my other foldables""  Let this video be the first time I've heard ANYONE say that! LOL"
It’s amazing  nice review
Kids today can't imagine the old days were we flipped the phone half
i love this phone and i think this is the best first gen foldable phone.
"Personally I'm not ready for a foldable, but if I'd get one it would be this. The design just looks so much better aside from the bezels which I don't really care about."
The best part of this foldabe is how every youtubers seems ordered not to say the dock similar to iPad OS
love how he has true love for his work
"I don't think that people that will buy this, will have any expectation from the camera. Also, the bezel it s a good rest for the finger without touching something. It's also about user experience.. Not always about performance or being the best at all. I think this phone, can turn me on to switch it to fold. For this money, have a phone and a small tablet, it's great!"
They're going to be able to focus on foldables through this.
I’m shocked that he didn’t Rick roll us with clear calling
"I think the 2nd generation of pixel fold or fold 6 will be an interesting upgrade from Fold 4. 

Fold 5 or Pixel fold is a negligible upgrade..."
this is good. google has finally set a standard for all android phones to follow. and also means google has finally created software specifically for foldable phones that other makers can license
"Througout the years my perception of foldables kinda changed. When  the Galaxy fold came out, I thought that I'd never buy one as I've seen it kinda impractical. But as the tech progressed and more and more companies make them now, I kind of want one. 

The Pixel Fold seems like a nice one too."
Love your content so much ️
Kids today don’t remember how cool it was to be able to flip a phone open .
I'm pretty sure it's the hinge mechanism not the camera responsible for the bezels.
"After owning all the Folds, going to wait for Apple to release a folding iPhone. iPhone to iPad would be ideal due to the application support for those screen sizes. Even with 50 apps, Android apps just aren’t tailored for them."
"""I thing she's checking out his hardware"" I burst out laughing"
I love how Arun took something most people would avoid in their artistic process and just worked with it
Arun never fails to make the audience laugh
"I loved the oppo n2 design and im glad yhe Pixel Fold is more wider than taller....i wont buy the 1st gen, but ill look into it once the 3rs gen comes through"
You should make a comparison between google's clear calling and samsung's voice focus
"I love the less excited and more calm vid like this.
Keep up the good work"
"They could have just gone with a notch inside or a punch hole camera, maybe those two options would cost them more"
This just opens up INSANE possibilities
"Honestly, I’m kinda sold on getting this. I’ve switched to Pixel 7 late 2022 after being an iPhone person for YEARS. And transition was smooth. And it was Black Friday so got a good deal 

But recently folds are grabbing my attention more; Pixel fold Moreso. I think for a first Gen Pixel Fold, I can tolerate details like the bevels. Soooooo after this video and MrMobile’s, I say I’m more sold on this"
It would be nice to see a more affordable foldable at around 1k USD with a chipset Snapdragon 7+ gen 2.  Current foldables are way too expensive even if u compare them too a good smartphone+ tab combo.
When will Google release all those crazy ai tools?
Logic would kinda dictate that you have a reduced chance of damaging the inner screen of a foldable if there is a gap and the screens arent pressing trapped debris on the inside.
Editing is still getting better! Good job! You will beat MKBHD!
"arun, you can answer calls without touching your phone on Samsung too, plus you have the s-pen, which takes productivity to a whole other level"
I love watching these videos as a person who's had the same Galixy s10e with a huge black chunk and rgb lights covering 15% of the screen since the phone came out. It really highlights the luxuries I could be enjoying but cant because I have no money
Glad for a first google and itineration and a competitor to Samsung. I might switch when the bezels will be smaller cause  I got bored of the Samsung and there's many things I dislike about fold 4
Checking his hardware got me dying
I thought someone was working with foldable glass? When will we see actual glass in a foldable phone? I imagine that would eliminate the crease when unfolded. I agree they need to use the latest and greatest hardware for that price like the S23 Ultra. Which I got for pre-ordering I bought for just over $500 through Spectrum mobile. I ordered that on Feb 1st when it started.
"I think foldables are still not there. Their size is still too big to carry, and i dont think people NEED that bigger screen at the cost of carrying this big hardware all the time. I'll wait"
Can we just appreciate how much work he puts into his videos.
Kids today don’t remember how cool it was to be able to flip a phone open
Kids today don’t remember how cool it was to be able to flip a phone open
"So, with my contract up in 2 months, which do I choose? Pixel Fold or Galaxy Fold 5? I'm a huge pixel fan since the nexus days. And didn't like my Note2."
"Ever since i changed to foldable, I'm never going back. And this foldable from Pixel could be exactly what I want"
"God, i miss having bezels on my phone. I hate being scared of grabbing it. 5:05"
This videos are always interesting and entertaining to watch
I liked the video a lot .I like the phones specs as well but i ought to wait till a newer model comes ! . Thank you
"If this phone was a few hundred less, I’d go with it. But for now I’ll stick with my fold 4 and see what the 5 has to offer."
"Pixel fold 2/3 I may replace my 2nd phone (s22 ultra currently) with 
My main phone for the foreseeable future is iPhone since ecosystem can’t be matched and the social media apps on my s22 ultra always feel way more broken than on the iPhone"
The closed design and front screen is already better than the fold.
"It is a great start for Pixel foldable, but I think I'll wait for awhile.

The battery efficiency of the 7 pro is meh at best already, and this doesn't bode well on this phone."
OMG! I didn’t know Google made a Pixel Fold. This looks amazing!
"For the price of a phone nowadays you can get a well maintained used car. These prices are really getting out of hand. But yes, it seems to be a really nice phone."
Kids today don’t remember how cool it was to be able to flip a phone open
You got to keep in mind they are using Samsung's exynos chip that overheats the battery quite a bit and drains the battery quite fast all they did is branded as the tensor chip that is it
I don't even that interested in phones and I still watched the whole video cause it's so good
"Arun can we get a review video on pixel 7a , it's an exciting device this year , would love to see your take on that"
Nah people really be crazy nowadays doing stuff in the open like that
Love how every new phone is instantly compared to samsung.
"The Strong app features are important and google are and should be very good at setting the bar or and improving the bar. but as for shape and size and the bezels size is a turn off . just the basic to form factor , i want a large outer screen that looks feels and function like a regular large smartphone and then opening it as a foldable should enhance the phone even using the open part to the function like two screens is a plus like the lgv60 dual screen concept. or a larger screen feature more screen real estate ."
"We are waiting for Apple's entry into the field of foldable phones, and if it enters it, it will definitely bring down all competing companies as it did with the laptop or tablet and others. At the moment, the Huawei foldable phone is the best phone in the world of its kind and Huawei has created it madly."
"With the next Z fold, I Wish samsung will let the samsung lettering on the hinge be illuminated. It may be a gimmick but it can be used as an alternative notification light. I still have my Samsung Armani m7500. Wish they would do something similar. This introduction of google now having a folding phone will force more innovation to breed in the folding phones sector wish is definitely what we need moving forward."
"All the features you mentioned, including Direct commands without waking the assistant, Object eraser, ai calls are already there in Samsung. And they do it better!!!"
The Answer or decline phone calls by speaking feature is on Samsung as well. I use it all the time. 7:51
I originally pre ordered the white one...but went ahead and canceled it for the black one ..the black one hides more of the bezel when it's closed
"I mean I'd love to pick the Pixel Fold up, but not for £1700."
Other tech tuber: reviewing Google pixel 7A .... But @Mrwhoistheboss : reviewing pixel fold .... That's what you call unique and fast
"for me i prefer top bezel with camera then punchole camera , but bottom bezel is a big no"
Isn't a fingerprint reader on the power key very inconvenient for left handers?
8:34 No way he just rickrolled us with that...
"Id thought it will be cheaper at least than the fold 4, but for the price, I would rather wait for the fold 5 it will be a more mature device and no huge notch."
If i had it i think id prefer just having the main cameras on the back and scrap the rest... Save on bezzle space then
"Those bezels tho... Big oof. Was fairly excited and thought about switching from my Fold 4, but I noped out once I saw the bezels."
"With that price point it should be a G3 chip, also all foldables should be 1TB just because of the price point,  hell maybe 2tb"
"""she is checking out his hardware"" bro i m laughing soo hard on this"
2:40 arun missed the best ever ”thats what she said” joke
This videos are always interesting and entertaining to watch
This made me SO HAPPY with my Fold4.
Look pretty cool. I use a pixel6 and 7pro now after being a Samsung fan thru all the Notes
"Literally, big companies should watch Arun's videos. That will help them get better and improve themselves. Prove me wrong."
The only folding phone I found interesting actually
"I'll be very fascinated how Michael Fisher will feel when he gets this Pixel Fold and reviews it. He's been using foldables since January 1, 2020. For this entire decade. But he's only been using Samsung foldables for the last 3.5 years. Those other ones are test units. Be curious how he'll feel going to a non-Samsung foldable as a daily driver for the first time in this decade."
1.5X Speed.  thank me later
"""It's less square than the samsung""

YA SURE ABOUT THAT?  They are nearly IDENTICAL 5:6  and 6:5 respectively.  Do your research, this is Engadget...."
"Looks like what the duo should have been. Shame Microsoft pretty much abandoned the device. But I always loved the form factor. I've used a fold forever, but these dimensions are what I loved about duo. So this is a day one purchase for me. Easy choice.  Just hope that the kindle app automatically defaults to the two column (two page) mode like the duo did. That's going to be an IMMEDIATE buy if it does. Can't wait for more reviews."
"The pricetag is a big disappointment. Only 3 countries get the pixel watch bundled with the phone in this price tag. Other countries where their currency is already weak due to rising $, other brands won't be worried as their prices are lower. Hopefully Google can slash their prices quickly in coming months."
Guessing they saved the thinner bezels for Pixel Fold 2.
"Seems like a very solid entry into the folding space, well done Google. I really like that they made it thinner than everyone else, it's an absolute must! My only big-ish concerns are battery life and price point. Crossing my fingers for black friday deals!"
"They should have the on-screen keyboard switch to a regular-ish keyboard (without the thumbs split) when in easel mode, so it's basically a laptop."
I am so excited about this. It is like the size of my old note phones that I have missed so much!!
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus, Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold 3 and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
"Google nailed with the form factor. Kinda like a throwback to those old 16:9 ratios, which comes in very handy in ""smartphone mode"". With Google doing the software work Im quite confident the Pixel Fold will take the foldable experience to another level.(at least for their formfactor). Bezels are a bit big on the interior screen but otherwise I love it. Also looking forward to Android 14 as it will bring major improvements for all foldable users(to some extent)."
Faster than google to announce the phone
"I like my Z flip 3, but miss some of the Pixel features. I don't know if I'll go for the fold out tablet style though. Wish they were releasing a flip style"
I like how they brought back the gray/silver finished color similar to the Nexus One. It was a must have phone at the time due to it being one of the first smart phones to break the 1Ghz CPU barrier.
"Reminds me on the Surface Duo, but without the bezels"
Samsung’s Z Fold 5 is what I’ll be waiting for
"I've been using the Z fold 3 for a quite a long time now. I skipped the Z fold 4 because it just didn't seem like it was worth the upgrade. The chinese (or where ever) foldables have that very inticing wide fold over samsungs thinner fold, and I've always wanted that on a phone based out of the U.S. I'll probably pick this up when (if) the price ever drops."
"I can't wait till the actual full review. I want to see if this phone interacts well with other Google products such as the new tablet and the current pixel phone. Also, I need to see if there are extra features on this device that are not on my pixel 7 pro. I don't want it to be just a pixel 7 pro with the ability to fold and unfold that would be a little redundant."
"I have to wait and see the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3, This very much feels like a V1 product, I hope to see large improvements next year."
"Yeah gonna have to buy a Google fold, I was thinking about a foldable and I was thinking about the z fold 5 coming  soon but I'm guessing Google will make their foldable way more affordable than samsungs and if that is the case then I'm going with google"
I can only dream of having a phone like this lol
I miss the time when he actually made an “Unboxing”
"Been a google fan since the pixel 2 XL, even when they didn't support all the features unless you had Verizon. Wonderful phones"
You guys should offer that case for the front as a screen protector and kinda makes it into a book. Keep your productivity in check lol
Absolutely love the design and aspect ratio.
For me the best foldable is the Microsoft duo. Two separate screens with the minimal hinge down the middle. A lot better than any foldable generic screen.
Would sure love to have a super thin case to put on it later
"I’d order that right now if I was able. FAR BETTER form factor than the Z Fold 5… and much better looking. Nice work, Google!"
"It’s been a while since I’ve watched Unbox Therapy, but I’m glad to see you’re videos are still high quality and informative"
"Amazing on the reaching for words to make this sound like there isn't other foldables. ""It's like a little laptop."" Lew's sliminess lemon carman salesman skills on full display."
"Im so proud of the google team and how much theyve achieved over a short time. Keep in mind google made the most legendary comeback with the 7 pro, thier second flagship. They failed with the 6 series, they listened to the audience, and fixed everything with the 7 series. Not only that but immediately after came out with a fold and a tablet. What a legendary company man"
Just watched the whole video! Super excited for it!
I want it so bad
"I'm gonna wait for the Pixel Fold A model. Google's budget phones are satisfactory, maybe more, for the price"
It's nice to see Lew chilled out
As expected weve seen the unboxed phone on the first frame of the video! I like this channel for this! Other Youtubers will take a lifetime to unbox a new product
Thats wild preparing for a video myself can’t wait to get my hands on to review
"Dare I say it but I actually like the fact it has bezels. This is one case where they not only perform a function, but actually look really good as far as the software and look of the phone all come together. I think it's really well designed."
"It's a stubby little guy, and I absolutely love it."
"The crease in the screen looks very prominent on the video, does it feel that way in person? Finally a folding phone I want to pick up."
"Damn. Haha I recently bought the fold 4, and I do love it. But I kinda want the pixel now haha"
"I must have blinked & missed you unboxing it. I actually, for the first time, wanted to see that"
This is damn awesome
This is just mind-blowing
The screen and glare on it are pretty gnarly… the design looks amazing though! Wish Samsung would do this form factor  can’t let go of my galaxy and especially my galaxy watch
My favorite part of this video was the unboxing
"This is a video editing masterpiece.

-CHRIS*STARR"
Wow!!! This will be my first fold.. previous folds disappoints
THE REAR CAMERA PANELING SHOULD DOUBLE AS A POP-OUT STAND.
Wonder if Google has finally enabled USB C Alt Mode DisplayPort for video...
Just preordered ! Had to get the $399 pixel watch since they wouldnt give me another $50 if i got the cheaper one
Man I tempted to give up my 14 pro max.. I miss my pixel 7 pro for multiple reasons but the battery life and stability on the iPhone is unmatched. I’m so tempted to get the fold
Loving the new set
Loved it
Great job from Google here. No doubt.
"i thought my next phone after pixel 7 would be S24U or S25U, but now i think it would be pixle fold 2 lol"
Looks dope!
"Looks sleek great job google. Only thing is the big bezels. Small screen factor 5' 8"". I know Google fold 2 will be better"
I just got a Pixel 7 Pro 3 months ago. NOW I want a Pixel Fold. I'm really happy with the Pixel 7 Pro. I switched from an iPhone 13 Pro Max.
Nice form factor just curious about the battery life
You are a real top g when it comes to tech search
Great content brother
"3:06 I highly doubt that. I have had two different Samsung folds (versions 2 and 3) I have never gotten anywhere close to all-day battery life. I'm sure the only way this phone could accomplish this would be to disable everything (Bluetooth, GPS, etc) except the cell signal and cut the brightness to as low as possible. But maybe this fold could be better than my Samsung fold."
"Love it. Won't buy it at that price...  i get they might be expensive to produce, but I'm simply not going over $1100-$1200 on a phone."
Foldables keep getting better
I wish my folding wallet is that thikkk
Been waiting 2yrs for this just pre-ordered on Google...Also already ordered my latercase in CRIMSON but can we do a LIME GREEN or CANDY GREEN colorway PLEASE!!!
"The biggest question is.. inner protective film, is going to be a problem after 4-6 months? like Z Fold/Flip is? (im z fold 3 user, changed inner film 2 times, since feb 22)"
I think Google took a step back on the inner display design with the bezels.. it reminds me of the old portable DVD players or the old flat screen TV with the bezels.. I will stick with Samsung or go with the Xiamoi Mix fold 3..
I think if apple keeps holding on to technology and not improving by much like the iPhone 15 Google can take a good portion of Apple phone sales. It would be a situation similar to what google went through with AI. Holding back and losing it to Microsoft
"using this might be huge benefits for streamers, content creators and office users"
Im more a samsung guy but this is nice. Price wise i have no need to upgrade from my s21+.
People aren't going to buy many cuz the Google first gen phobia. Love you guys ️
I pre-order mine today. I am kinda surprised how much you can see the crease when it is open.
Man i wish it had pen input!!!
"What's funny is that the ""mini laptop"" analogy isn't much different than the dual screen experience that the LGV60 ThinQ 5G dual screen what the second screen could've been a keyboard, a game controller or a tripod. None of these revelations you're having are new. I thought the Samsung Fold would've been doing that already as well since it's such an old logical feature. What I want to know is if they're adding multiple windows in it's UI like LG and Samsung do in the software"
Will there be later cases for the pixel fold? NVM my question was answered lol
I really wish they would make it a point to also state the Canadian prices
I currently have pixel 5 and need a new phone. Ive had one of the worst experiences with pixel 5. Definitely didnt live uo the expectations i set for them before switching from an iphone. What phone should i get in July. I'm so lost
I love how conscious you are not to show the crease when you open the phone
"Been waiting for this, Thankyou Sir"
They need to thin those bezels for me really want to switch my z fold 3 if it weren't for that
I love the background music ...really a nice phone
Front screen is about to make me switch from my samsung fold 3 device  that's the reason I didn't get the 4 actually why I purchased a galaxy 22 plus after cause of the uncomfortable typing
"Lew hasn't been feeling like himself lately, hard times.."
brought back the finger print scanner finally
Amazing
"Maybe next time you should put it next to a Samsung Fold, or an iPhone... just so we can get a sense of the size of the outside screen... As we all know the inside screen is big."
"I have still a bitter taste with my fold 3 breaking in the crease with black ink coming out... Lot of users have that common defect and Samsung denies everything. I got to say that when it worked, I I did loved that device. The Pixel Fold sounds sweet for how wide it is on the front screen, one major flaw I think the Z Fold series has. The screen was so tiny that with my huge hand, I had trouble typing."
It would be great with 8 Gen 2 instead of rebranded Exynos called Tensor
Now this looks cool
You have the best ideas.
When im on the cough is when i get a real tablet that has more power and even bigger screen :) I mean the fold looks nice but the price is just insane.
Would be great if it was available in Canada.
I like the idea of a  Google fold i had pixels even a nexus you can't get them fixed or find cool phone cases
Hopefully there's a dev setting to keep 120 refresh rate
Keep it up fold phones and apple pay attention to the innovation
"Was waiting for Lew to say; ""This has been a paid program."""
"I don’t mind the Internal screen bezel, it looks good, no notch or hole feels clean, this is the first folding phone I want to buy."
Love for Google and love for Lewis George Hilsenteger
"This looks incredible. A considered approach and a great 1st shot at a foldable. Unfortunately I’m insanely deep in the Apple ecosystem, so hopefully they build one soon! I really want this!"
The folding phone I've been waiting for
"You seem to be excited for basically the same features found on folding devices prior. While the form factor ratio is much usable IMO when closed, a lot of features have been done before. We should just be excited that the folding market in the US has competition."
"This Pixel Fold might be very solid for a Gen 1 product which is surprising because Apple, Google, and Samsung are not the greatest with Gen 1 products."
Can you please do a review of the viture one glasses and neckband. Would love to have a real review of these glasses before I fork out. Not many  reviews on YouTube
Mě se to líbí. Pěkný to je
Amazing
I have to 7 pro but that's cool as hell
"I do think that the form factor is much better than the competition, but I don't think they're going to disrupt the market as much due to the crease sticking out in the unfolded mode. Apparently Samsung have fixed the crease in the up and coming galaxy fold 5 but we'll see!"
"With those Bezels from 2015, it should've been $1,000. Let me be the first to say, DOA."
I don't think you can call it unboxing if you unboxed it off-screen lol
"Nice. We all know Samsungs' ZFold led us here but hey.... we now have ""less Benjamin paying"" options (at 1700 plus) and still get that Tablet in a phone Artist Option. Anyone know if Verizon includes this Fold Phone yet?"
Noice . But too expensive for us
"What is the circle with the - symbol between the battery and voicemail notification on the AOD?
Also, can you not get below 60hrtz if you don’t turn on “smooth display”? It doesn’t make sense that you can’t get full use of the panned being able to save you some battery"
Great for old Galaxy fold users. They are giving $750 for Fold2 $800 for Fold3 along with Pixel watch(wifi or lte).
"Beautiful phone, beautiful review"
"Damn, this is priced higher than an RTX4090?! …"
Durability would be main concern..
Been waiting 2yrs for this...Already pre-ordered just waiting for the latercase announcement to buy it PLEASE!
"He's had it for 6 days already, I should've been a tech reviewer"
With that laptop mode u can give it a tripod like stability to capture astrophotography amazingly!
"I like my Z flip 3, but miss some of the Pixel features. I don't know if I'll go for the fold out tablet style though. Wish they were releasing a flip style"
"Google nailed with the form factor. Kinda like a throwback to those old 16:9 ratios, which comes in very handy in ""smartphone mode"". With Google doing the software work Im quite confident the Pixel Fold will take the foldable experience to another level.(at least for their formfactor). Bezels are a bit big on the interior screen but otherwise I love it. Also looking forward to Android 14 as it will bring major improvements for all foldable users(to some extent)."
Absolutely love the design and aspect ratio.
I am definitely the target demographic in all aspects but price  still waiting for someone to make a budget version of this form factor lol
"It's looking pretty good, I know Google's got developers  that are going to create some custom ROM'S for this phone, and it's going to have features because of it that no other phone has already, and then with the custom ROM it's just going to kick the rest of the phone companies right in the ass, and this is their first generation of a fold phone and it's still going to kick the rest in the ass, it's looking pretty good."
"Yeah gonna have to buy a Google fold, I was thinking about a foldable and I was thinking about the z fold 5 coming  soon but I'm guessing Google will make their foldable way more affordable than samsungs and if that is the case then I'm going with google"
Damn cool lookin phone ...like the wider front screen
"Simply the Best folding phone right now, no doubt"
I can only dream of having a phone like this lol
Just watched the whole video! Super excited for it!
"Nice review, miss the cheap gadget reviews"
Faster than google to announce the phone
This is damn awesome
Thats wild preparing for a video myself can’t wait to get my hands on to review
I really like Google. I do have the pixel 7 really good phone! Would recommend it to everyone. But this would be to big for me HAHA but nice product.
"I have to wait and see the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3, This very much feels like a V1 product, I hope to see large improvements next year."
This is just mind-blowing
"I'm gonna wait for the Pixel Fold A model. Google's budget phones are satisfactory, maybe more, for the price"
Guessing they saved the thinner bezels for Pixel Fold 2.
Loved it
I want it so bad

Do manufacturers test how many folds before damage to the display occurs and if they do why is it not advertised?
"Google’s metaphor with the wallpaper. Wings, folded."
"Reminds me on the Surface Duo, but without the bezels"
You have the best ideas.
Foldables keep getting better
Looks dope!
"I can't wait till the actual full review. I want to see if this phone interacts well with other Google products such as the new tablet and the current pixel phone. Also, I need to see if there are extra features on this device that are not on my pixel 7 pro. I don't want it to be just a pixel 7 pro with the ability to fold and unfold that would be a little redundant."
I wish my folding wallet is that thikkk

"Unless they come out with a smaller version at a more affordable cost, it doesn't beat the galaxy flip for me. But I would grab in an instant if I had money on hand best overall in terms of flip phones, in my opinion."
"Dawm it man, I'm gonna have to switch to Google now  why did Google have to go ahead and made a foldable? now I am more interested in switching"
"At this point, can I just have a phone with two screens? Microsoft had the Duo, but it was Microsoft and the specs were already behind when they made it."
"Its temping, I might trade my fold 4 depending on the review that are to come."
I think the aspect ratio here makes more sense than the z fold's
Lew are you gonna review the xperia 1 V when it comes out? It's gonna unveil/announce today.. the 1 V will use the new sensor for all the smartphones in the future
It’s beautiful
I'm in the UK i know you ship here but if I buy the later case for the pixel fold will it arrive in time for the phone release date? Just unsure if you have to ship from canada or if you have drop ship facilities in UK or EU.
You do know this split view works on the Fold 4 right?
Loved this video
The way you always know when someone needs something is amazing.
Good old 7 frames a second.
"Just the external front is good. 5.8 inche, half the thickness."
The wider screen I'm jealous about that. I have the fold 3 and the front screen is fkn annoying.
So dope
by watching this video I realize that the crease on the pixel fold resembles that of the Galaxy z fold 4. on the vivo x-fold and the vivo x fold 2 the crease is much less visible.  on the other hand for the software part I think that Google is in front
"I'm gonna wait for the Pixel Fold A model. Google's budget phones are satisfactory, maybe more, for the price"
Which makes me want to trade in my Zed 3 and Zed 4 for a Google pixel fold.
"While I'm a pixel user and excited to see where foldables go, I find the design already looking a tad dated. I'm sure they'll get better and better like everything else in tech."
Amazing!
The outer screen is going to get trashed using it as a tripod. It's on the bottom when you use it that way.
"Apple: we never believe in fold 
️Steve: is that my last innovation what they are still using"
Absolutely love the design and aspect ratio.
"My 2023 Smartphone Wishlist

"square display is better, i hope tech companies will finally get it."
"Looks good,but the bezels kill it for me,like the Z Folds the next generation will improve that?I'll stick to Z Folds for now"
Wow. You synced your video release as Google's release of the foldables.
Those bezels....they waited for years to do this and this is the best they can do?  Way overpriced for its limitations unfortunately but not like i have to worry about not getting one since the geniuses at google arent even selling it in Canada lol
It’s cool but I don’t think it’s better than my z fold 4
I bet you make babies smile.
Why does the wall look like a diamond block in minecraft? Keep up the work lew!
This phone will be a huge hit on YouTube . In real life no one is spending $1800 on a first gen google product that looks like a Chinese knock off of the fold
"I had a pixel 2 XL. Even back then, they took great photos."
"Should've been as tall as the ZFOLD4.
I want to see ""full screen"" (movie aspect ratio) media/video content comparisons between the two."
Laughs in Oppo Find N2 Fold!
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content !!
Perfect dimensions for a folding phone
"While the phone looks very nice, I'm surprised about 2 things: 1- nobody mentioned that crease down the middle that everyone freaks about on the Samsung Fold.  2 - Pen Support????  One of the main items I use on my Fold 4.  And actually #3, outside of the aspect ratio on the Pixel, there was not one other item in this review that I can't do with my Fold 4, for exactly the same price, so there really isn't anything new here, I'll stick with my Fold."
Faster than google to announce the phone
"Seems super nice, but I just can't find the larger display useful at all for me, personally.  It is especially not worth the risk at the price that it is currently listed for!  I mean, I could buy this phone and then possibly dislike it.....or I could just buy an old car that can be repaired with a small amount of money lol."
the crease of the  device is the first thing I see opening the phone .....  double it so flat maybe is high risk to create a potencial point of failure.... in the Fold series the gap is there for something
Google needs to really learn how to create a very reliable and clean phone before they go into making a folding phone. Their normal phones have enough issues already.
"Aspect ratio like the Surface Duo is nice, that price though is way out there, should be under $1,500."
as always with Google they will start with hardware level products with very low quality definition.  (pixel 3 and 3 pro. pixel 4 and pixel 4 pro with their huge black border at the top and bottom. fingers crossed it gets better in the years to come. (especially at this price!! the pixel  fold still costs 1800 dollars
"Yeah gonna have to buy a Google fold, I was thinking about a foldable and I was thinking about the z fold 5 coming  soon but I'm guessing Google will make their foldable way more affordable than samsungs and if that is the case then I'm going with google"
"If Gen 2 keeps the form factor, significantly minimizes bezels, and adds standard features such as wireless charging and fast wired charging, i'll ditch my Z Fold. Like this form factor much more than Samsung"
Dno about this form factor. I like the fact that the Samsung fold is really slim in the hand when folded. This looks very wide.
Guessing they saved the thinner bezels for Pixel Fold 2.
This is a surface duo with an external display and a full internal screen.
"I'll be honest, I actually like the bit thicker bezels. It actually looks good and it gives more space to avoid unintended touches."
Awesome
The thick bezels make this look like a budget fold phone
Huge phone :O
Guessing they saved the thinner bezels for Pixel Fold 2.
I like the look of that. But how heavy is it? Is it  going to pull my pants down if I put it in my pocket or on my belt (in a holster)? Is the hinge durable? How many times can you open and fold it before the inner display develops a crack where it folds? How visible is the fold in the inside when you're using it to watch a video or just using it in general? Is it obvious? Is it annoying at all? Does it cause any problems with viewing things right on the fold?

"In Asia, a lot of brands already have foldables and flip phones. Aside from Samsung's Z Fold 4/ Flip 4, we also have:

I love my Google pixel pro!!!! Now that is a must have. I want it so bad lol
This Google Pixel is actually a Cellphone and a Tablet it's what you could Actually Turn Those Things Around and So Does the Other Electronics Too like the Microsoft Devices and the Apple Devices and you could Turn Those Things into Some of the LabTops Too but I actually Have a Chromebook already that Looks Bigger better than the Small LabTops at this Time that's what I Like some of the Biggest Computers Better then the Small Ones at this Time that's it and the new iPhone and iPod touch is where I have but I Don't have a iPad at this Time but I wish I wanted one Infact I Could Dress up as a Computer Hacker during the next Year of Halloween that's what I will be Dressing up as.
those bezels are thicker than my grandma's glasses XD
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content !!
Seeing all the YouTube hype for features that have been available on foldables for years is a little weird. A built-in kickstand? OMG!
️️
"They really said its the thinnest foldable 

Google or America in general dont like Chinese competition"
The Bezel is an absolute killer of disappointment. I cant stop seeing the bezel as a zfold 3 user it would feel like a downgrade almost like a cheaper product.
love. it.
That bezel is unacceptable when literally every other company offers much better design in that department
"That external display on this compared to the Galaxy Fold is a lot better. I loathe using the external display on my Fold 3, it's just too cramped. Google nailed the aspect ratio on this display in comparison by a mile."
"We are waiting for Apple's entry into the field of foldable phones, and if it enters it, it will definitely bring down all competing companies as it did with the laptop or tablet and others. At the moment, the Huawei foldable phone is the best phone in the world of its kind and Huawei has created it madly."
I want an 8inch tablet that folds to a smart phone
"13 Make allowance for each other’s faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. (‭‭‭Colossians‬ ‭3‬‬:‭13‬ ‭NLT‬‬)"

We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content !!
"He quickly moves onto a different subject when he was talking about the internal display, but the fact is, its as fragile as the samsung fold phones, you can still damage it with your fingernails.

This guy is obviously more into views and money rather than a genuine no frills umboxing and review, no criticism either, only good things."
I gotta hand it to google for making their first ever fold better than samsung. When samsung released their fold it has that ugly annoying dip on the right side of the inner display while google was able to keep the screen flat and no annoying distractions. Yes it's their first foldable and over the years their technology will advance but for now they knocked this device out of the ball park. Well done Google
Usable front screen!
"Definitely got paid by Google for this video. All the features he was stating is on all foldable phones. It's as if he was looking at notes to say, as struggled to talk fluently. Seen so many videos from him, but was definitely weird. That amount of money for a big bezzle (almost like Samsung fold 1 from 4 years ago!) average chip at best and the value being the same price as Samsung fold 4."
"feel like for the price its def not good enough, just my opinion"
"Seems like you can't even use it single handed when folded unless you've got giant hands. Defeats the purpose IMO. Foldables are a cool idea, but idk how can anyone be a fan of the direction the industry is taking. We're getting smartphones that are non repairable, the features are being taken away and the prices are increasing to stupid amounts. No expandable storage or 3.5mm jack, even though there's place and use case for it. The new Android UI is just disgusting and it looks like it's made for toddlers with those large, single tone, flat look icons. No thanks."
Wow Apple needs to step up quickly I kinda want this
nice
Anyone know what mic he is using?
7:37 that zoom.
Nice background. Possibly next phone upgrade. Any phone case needed ? Or Popsocket ?

"Smaller battery bigger screen than the 7 n 7 pro, wonder how's the battery life?"
Will be my upgrade as I have pixel 7 pro and iPhone 14 pro but I don’t need iPhone 15 will take Google’s flip and keep my iPhone 14 pro with it  can’t wait
Wow what a beautiful clean device I
I'm so glad they didn't go with the tall narrow design
What is compatible pen on this device?
"I'll be very fascinated how Michael Fisher will feel when he gets this Pixel Fold and reviews it. He's been using foldables since January 1, 2020. For this entire decade. But he's only been using Samsung foldables for the last 3.5 years. Those other ones are test units. Be curious how he'll feel going to a non-Samsung foldable as a daily driver for the first time in this decade."
"Looks like an awesome device to me. Love the form factor and the pixel camera 

Just concerned about the battery life"
Missing Spen support is really a killer for me . I use the spen on my zfold4 to sign pdf files on the weekly basis.
This pixel fold kind of hit the ground running which is always cool to see
They definitely should have undercut Samsung by at least $150.
Google phones are always heavily discounted within a couple of months of launching - I think they probably wanted to make sure there was no perception that this is a budget phone with a lower price. They wanna peg it as a flagship. But still accessible with all the discounting later on.
"Side note: my Pixel Watch has had awesome battery life after the updates, and it's actually super easy for me to recommend. It's easily the best first generation device I've ever used. So I guess your mileage may vary? But I've got high hopes for their foldables after seeing what the Pixel Fold has to offer."
"I don't kno if parts are already so expensive that they're maybe already selling at a loss, but at a 1000 dollars this would fly off store shelves and push the industry forward. I think that's worth the loss in profits per unit in my inexperienced opinion"
This already looks peak design IMO. bezels are fine and leave some room for you to grab the phone. I also like how bezels 'frame' the screen on my laptop so background doesnt distract me. If the battery and screen holds up idk how they could even improve this. Front facing speakers would be cool actually
"I'm waiting for the IP68 foldable, but this is such a good looking phone though!"
I don't believe this has dust resistance as one of your slides show.
"Legitimate price for the pixel fold is €1499,- for the 512gb with old hardware from last year. 

For the 256gb €1399,-"
I got the fold 4 for $450... Im sticking with that.
"Google and Samsung are partners, very close at that, hardware and software, so I suspect that Google did not want to engage in a price war with Samsung. Hence the similar pricing. I suspect that both companies are losing money with foldable’s, so they do not need to make things worse."
Great looking phone!!
Google Pixel fold does look good design wise but the Samsung Z fold just looks and feels sharper but in reality props to Google who are trying new designs unlike iPhones who have kept the same design for god knows how long.
They kill the fold before it was even launch  price is just insane
"If you remember when Samsungs first fold came out, it was $2000. Their second version was $2000 and they’re still in business making foldable’s."
No matter what a company do or doesn't do... someone will complain about something!️
"i think as consumer we should give company like huge company as Google to use ""1st gen"" product as excuse for not able to produce good product at the first place. after all competitors already in 3rd. 4th and 5th gen. plenty of samples for reverse engineering and understanding. 
even pixel 7 pro which already at 7th gen (or more when include nexus phones) still lack battery efficiency optimization compared to their competitors (e.g samsung, oppo etc)"
I wouldn't pay more than $1200 for that. I will wait for the Pixel fold 2 or 3 when the price has settled.
The Huawei Mate X3 is currently to date the thinnest 'foldable' phone.
Holding off until i see the battery life tests
can a company make a foldable tablet
"If Surface Duo and Find N2 had a baby...
iPhone 13 mini: 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.7 mm
Find N: 132.6 x 73 x 15.9 mm
Find N2: 132.2 x 72.6 x 14.6 mm"
"I don't think many people understand the pricing of Pixel Fold. It is their first gen product. The Samsung Galaxy Fold 1 is way more expensive than this price range if I remember. Google offers many features that Samsung didn't in their first gen. This is for people who want to try out the first gen Fold, not for your average consumer. You can say the same with pixel watch. These have been in development for years. The first gen is always more expensive. Hopefully the next generation pixel watch amd pixel fold either get cheaper or get more features for the price."
The google pixel fold is basically an oppo find N if it was design by an intern
I love my Pixel watch
Oppo Find N2 solved the crease problem
"This looks awesome. I really want one, but I am not paying $1800 for a phone. for that price I can buy a iPhone 14 Pro AND an 11"" iPad pro....  get this down to $1199 and I will buy it."
Should have started at $1299

The battery is too small for this phone and this  price.
Google has a very poor market policy not to include Hong Kong in their google shop range.
All folding phones are a bad idea. You can put a case on them so they were going to be destozyined when you drop it and you know you will.
"The price,man they really missed the opportunity to undercut Samsung. pass"
I'm waiting for a Pixel Flip
"Way too expensive  needs to drop $500 off to be wanted, $$$$$$$$$$&"
Smaller battery and same SoC/RAM as Pixel 7 Pro that already has poor battery life. And that price tag...
Google asking too much money.
The Surface Duo 2 is not a real foldable so im not why you're comparing it to an actual foldable.
The first fold was 2k
"No phone is worth 1800.  It's awesome, but never going to spend that much on a phone"
Pixel trying to clear out that 4 year old processor pixel watch so 4 year old pixel watch stock.
"Is that a plastic (saran wrap-like) screen protector on it or the actual glass on the inside (unfolded) screens? It looks like crap!! Seriously, at the 50-55 second mark when the Pixel Fold is open and is tilted (for a very brief moment) you can see the film-like screen that is very ugly and bubbly. Some type of temporary protector Google through on the device during the mass reviews outside it's presentation?"
Hot!
Compare with huawei mate x3 not even close..
Nah google smoking that potent fentanyl
"3 disappointment,  price, size, crease,  samsung should release z fold 5 soon"
"1800... LOL, unless its Zimbabwean dollars or something."
there is no way you can say samsung is the lead in foldable they are in foldalbe since time now they will realse dead on arrive fold 5 its the opposite they are the worse one nobody need narrowest outer screen that have no use - iam so proud of google copying oppo find n really google is so smart move
"The width is great but it's too short and makes the front screen too small hard to read, Samsung is too narrow and Google is too short"
"This is total overkill lol. I just need a Tesla or Toyota.....not a BUGATTI . 
In all seriousness tho, its kinda crazy that you can get a brand new Pixel 7 Pro, and a Pixel Tablet with the dock included for less than the price of this phone alone . 
They are definitely targeting wealthy individuals and those who like to waste money, thats for sure lol."
"Google is so smart the dumb, should've made it 1000-1200"
Not feeling that crease.
"How much was the original Galaxy fold? Oh Yeah!! $1999, and not even close on features, and a much more terrible battery!!"
The thing which I can't stand is mainly Tensor chip. It's pretty obvious that the speed is slow. I did like to buy Pixel 6 but Mr Tensor discouraged me. Pixel 7 is the same as well. We need something fast like Oneplus(not now though with the ridiculous new UI) Well pure Android with Snapdragon chipset inside!
Where is the pen?
A crease and it doesnt unfold flat it looks kinda raised
"what´s this device have to make such a great product as you said? any diferent from Oppo, Huawei, Samsung....? I cant see any thing new here apart from software, that any other foldables in the market doesnt make it better. The crease, better? nope. The battery, with Tensor G2, better? dont think so. The size of internal screen, better? Nope. The cameras, wiil see. The screen quality, better? nope. The price range? very high to enter in the game too late. and those bezzels!"
"Google fell off when they stopped using Snapdragon

If Pixel phones not selling that good and it's not even global? I don't know how this can become hit"
Chineas foldables beat that
Too expensive with less feature and slower processor
The cameras aren't $500 better than the Find N this thing is based on. And this thing looks worse than both it and the Fold 4. Google needs to slash that price.
No thanks.  Overpriced for a 1st Gen product.
