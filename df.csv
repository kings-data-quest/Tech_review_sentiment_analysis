Great first look. Question. Isn't having a third selfie camera too much? I heard they made those bezels big to accommodate more space for that selfie camera. But why is it necessary to have it in the first place, there are already 2 camera's, does it really need a third? Especially if you can use the main camera as a selfie camera.

Google needs to push for trade-in deals. The reason I like it is because it's small when closed like a Find N and N2. The big bezels don't really bother me.

On AT&T, they're very selective with which phones working on their 5G network. I can't import an Oppo Find N2 or vivo X Flip. My only foldable choices are really from Samsung and maybe Motorola. At least Pixel Fold offers a different alternative for those who don't want Samsung. This is really what the Surface Duo 1 and 2 should've been.
