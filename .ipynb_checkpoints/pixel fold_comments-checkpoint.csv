Excellent coverage
"Googles call screening and voice to text in real time on voicemail is so good. The little UI elements and software quirks are what keep me going back to pixel after I originally got the 6 (which was awful btw, many apps were bugged and I had a lot of frustrations) but the little things made me try the 7 and I've loved it. It's gorgeous, it's sturdy, and it does so many little things better than it's contemporaries that I'll probably also check the 8 out. I just wish I could make use of the camera a better without needing to be a shutter nerd because my wife's s22 ultra has a better camera out of the box without tweaking than I feel my pixel 7 does"
Went from fold 3 to fold 4. Had my eyes on the 5 but I'm glad google threw their hat in the ring to offer some viable competition to the foldable king. Can't wait for the full review.
"Ah yes, I love thick bezels in 2023. Despite that, I'm glad Samsung is finally getting some real competitions in the foldable space. This will push them and everyone else to make better products"
"LOVE how you banged out this video while Google IO was still going on. I would say it definitely looks impressive. As a person who has a Fold 3 and only rocks a Google Pixel 6 Pro because I LOVE the Google UI, Haptic feedback as well as the camera, I may have to scoop this up. I also LIKE the shorter/wider form factor compared to the longer/narrower one of the Fold series. Honestly it's either this or the OPPO Find N2(which I can get for cheaper here). Thanks again for this LOVELY video and we all look forward to the real review."
I think it'll be good for the foldable segment now that google will tailor software updates for the format. Not enough to tempt me from my z fold 4 but im definitely curious about using a phone with that aspect ratio of the outer display. I regularly feel constricted by the narrow outer display and thats it being a good upgrade from my old fold 2. Hopefully they go wider again with the 5.
Exiting times ahead for the foldable side of things. Great storytelling as always. I still seem to be tilting on the side of Galaxy Fold 5 when it’s out.
"Really great news for the foldable fans. Not only will some competition help push things forward, but the added software support from Google throwing their hat in the ring will be huge.

Also, I like the bezels. I'd rather have thicker bezels again to hold cameras. I've never been a fan of the hole punch approach. It's usually something I can get used to, but I still find it's occasionally in the way."
Really interesting to see how the screen stands up to 12 months of use and how the warranty will support wear and tear of the hinges and on/off button and screen quality. Very interesting mix of subjects. A comparison between Galaxy and Google is exciting.
"Thanks so much for bringing us with you to check out the Pixel Fold! I'm looking forward to the software optimizations this device will bring to the entire Android foldable space (hopefully). The Fold & Pixel Tablet are the two things I'm most interested in at this year's I/O; hopefully you get a look at the tablet as well. Your reviews are very straightforward, with clearly stated pros & cons of the devices that you review, and I very much appreciate that aspect of your content."
I'm more interested to see how this causes waves in the foldable space now that google has it's own foldable.  Some of the software enhancements won't make it to my Fold 4 (or potentially Fold 5 depending on carrier trade-in/subsidies) but you're right when you say that it means foldables are here and not just a gimmick.
Sir I had a fold 1 and currently a fold 3. Thank you so much for your constant fold coverage. You are a big reason I got into foldables
This is the first foldable that I've really loved the look of. I really like my Pixel 6 and having a foldable Pixel that's still just as modding friendly would be a dream. But at that price I'd need to wait like 3 generations at least hahaha
"So excited you're covering this, first foldable I've considered since hearing about it. Very excited for your coming reviews of it."
Impressive job on the video while on the road! Love to hear that it does indeed feel like a duo. Would've loved to see them side by side but i guess there's only so many phones you can bring  please ask them whether they are considering a multitasking -first mode like duo!
"That Pixel Fold looks super tempting as I’ve been thinking about considering an upgrade from my Z Flip3 to a book-style foldable. I just wish that Pixel devices were more available globally because, although I haven’t checked in a while, I believe Pixel is not officially sold here in NZ and, if I want one, Might have to get out my Passport and fly to Australia to buy one. Or somehow import it from somewhere."
"Hope to see Google announce something like the S-Pen for this, because that's a big reason I want to upgrade to a Fold 5 when it comes out. The use my Note 20 Ultra gets as a productivity, notetaking and edoc signing monster is just as valuable to me as it's cameras, when despite how much flexibility you have with the fold with its ""built in tripod"", still have me contemplating going for the S23 Ultra or even waiting for the 24 Ultra."
Definitely very interesting addition to the foldable market and I think you'll be right on your thoughts about android being more optimised for foldables
"Your review videos of foldable phones are fantastic. Every time I watch any foldable review, I feel mesmerized. The phone specifications are covered in great detail. The reviews are finely edited. I wish I had those wonderful phones. Please keep on making great review videos."
It's so exciting to have your commentary on this. You did a great job at capturing the genuine excitement this phone brings to the market!
"The form factor of this one is perfect. Absolutely adore it. I guess I'm starting to save now.

Every artist, graphic designer and meme maker I know is drooling over this phone. This might finally knock the ""couple of years old galaxy note"" from it's spot as the phone of choice for android based artists."
"Have been following his journey from pocket now to this channel. And it amazes me how well mrmobile has been able to differentiate from rest of the tech channels. Also, I don't think the bezels are much, they hide the camera and if you're lying down on the bed, they give you space to hold the phone and control phantom touches. Again, just my opinion."
Appreciate the quick coverage and your commitment to your job as a tech communicator. The message you presented may be obvious to those following your channel / the industry in general but it's still well worth saying and spreading to many that have forgotten or remain unaware.
"Much like the early smartphones of the mid 2000s, each new iteration brought so many improvements it was hard to justify buying last years model, even if it meant you could save a ton of money. Nowadays though, you could buy a 3 year old phone and probably not notice too much different compared to the brand new, full priced phone. I feel like foldables will get to that same point in the next ~5 years or so, and that's probably when I can justify buying one. For now, I live vicariously through people that can afford them."
"NICE! I hope the guys at Google appreciated the fact you sported the Levi's Google Jacquard jacket! Interesting device. I went from Fold 1 to Surface Duo to Fold 2 and  back to Surface Duo (when they finally fixed the firmware), with a couple of Flips mixed in ... I prefer the size and aspect of the Duo to the Samsung Fold, and this Pixel Fold seems to be the right candidate for my next phone!"
I'm very happy that you were able to cover this at the same time as everyone else so we could get your first impressions at the same time.  Thanks for the video and I look forward to the full review!
I’m really excited for the new razr and galaxy flip. here’s hoping they love up to even half our expectations
"Great video Michael! I'm so glad to hear you're initial assessment of the pixel fold. I'll be very excited to hear your full length review of it, and if you think it, it is price matched very well. Have fun!"
"As a disappointed Duo owner who moved on (but still uses that phone as an e-reader) I really like what I'm seeing here. One question I have is does it have dual SIM/esim support (a feature I've come to love on my Sony Xperia 3 mk III)?
Update: I checked the spec page (duh) and it does have dual sim support (1 nano sim and 1 esim)."
Not gonna lie I would trade my Z Fold 4 for this but I'm still paying the Fold off  perhaps the next gen lol but I do hope it works out for ppl. I wonder how samsung will respond in the up coming versions  if there's one thing I miss from a traditional phone is how wide the front screen is. Yes I can open my flip for better messaging but it's not what I want to do all the time!
"Thanks a lot for a great first presentation of this foldable phone! I have a very special (perhaps) question about a very specific way of using this phone primarily (not exclusively): A tablet mode with a (screen, of course) keyboard on a table or on the lap and a screen in a ""regular"" laptop position. Can you please check out how writing text (a story or notes) in this way is a good way to use this phone (in the same way as an old Nokia Communicator, for instance)? Please check this out both hardwarewise and softwarewise."
"More foldables is always good, but those cameras better be really good to justify this over a Samsung fold. I don't see any other killer feature"
"As someone who is currently watching this on the z fold 3, I am going to have to see a full review and get a hands on at my verizon store before I consider leaving the galaxy line.  It looks incredibly promising.  But right now Samsung has such a far ahead lead on the rest of the folding market, it's hard to beat"
"Michael, a small correction for you regarding puxel-exclusive features. Call screening is available on some Motorola and Sony phones now. I've had it prompt me a couple times on my Xperia 1III (I don't get many  calls)"
"I'm tempted, but I am still smitten with my Z Fold 3, so I think I will hold out for the Fold 5 this summer. I'm sticking with the Samsung Folds, because I have chucked my Fold 3 around (by accident) and used it for work in some very dirty and wet project sites, and it still works perfectly and is an excellent size. I am curious as to how Google's screen will fare compared to Samsung's earlier models or if these will be just as sturdy as Samsung's current offerings? I am just happy to see that we are getting more options in the US market, because I could never go back to a standard brick phone."
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus, Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold 3 and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
That disclaimer at the end is what makes your word and content so trustworthy. I admire your honesty and as well the quality of your videos. Thank you Michael.
"Good to see an alternative for Samsung for the Western markets (thoguh it still won't come to my country but at least proper network support is there) and I'm optimistic that a Google foldable will help create better app support for these rectangular inner screens and tablets. But I still wouldn't get this phone, look great folded but the inner screen is such an eyesore. Not up to the standards for 1800 dollars it would bother me even at half price. I just hope Samsung will make real improvements this year."
"Oh, have i been waiting for this. Rocking a galaxy fold 3 right now, probably gonna hold on to it for a year or 2 more, but i really want some competition in this space. Im going to want some options when i upgrade later and this seems like a good start!"
"Excited to see your full review on this, you are really looking at it from the best angle, as a fold phone power user.
Thanks for your early impressions."
"Question: did you try Microsoft apps like outlook?  If it looks like a duo, does it apply Microsoft's 2 'page' solutions?  That would be cool.   And I am assuming no stylus support?"
"The ViVo X Fold Design and features is what the standard should be like . the MATE X goes a bit forward with being slim . What i want in an Foldable is the main large screen that functions like a regular large phone , without opening and the plus feature would be when opened with proper apps i can use it as a large tablet form of a two screen function to feel independent of each other like what the Lgv60 Dual screen did ."
Respect to Google for letting the folding tech connoisseur take a look at this.
I really hope quad lock or rokform make a case for this phone. Only reason I ditched the fold 3 was the lack of good mounts for my motorcycle. This phone makes me want to maybe find and Jerry rig something to work.
"DBrand's integrated kickstand is definitely appealing, (and really should be a first party option).  Otherwise the $1,700 is far too high.  But Google did beat Apple to offering a foldable.  I guess now that there are actually 2 options in the US will prices finally begin to come down (so 2024 maybe?  Sigh)"
I love how the Pixel Fold still has a physical SIM tray!
This might be my first foldable. Waiting for a good trade price for 7 pro.
"So excited this device is fnally real. Just to build competition and make Samsung try to be a little more then an iterative change the last couple years.

Is there any type of pin support on the inner display?"
"That smile on your face as the phone was handed to you said it all.
No more ""jaded tech journo"" here.
Definitely doing much of it's own thing and planting a flag for what Google's vision for a foldable is.
I'm still not sure about the effect of creases on longevity - I have a materials engineering background and repeated folding always worries me."
"If they get the price right i might spring for an early upgrade to my pixel 6. 

Also i hope they get a lot of the software issues sorted with ""tablet"" apps on Android"
Had the Fold 3 had bad battery life and was disappointed with the camera.  I am looking forward to the reviews on this much needed foldable.
The first one for my favourite Storyteller YouTuber… Cheers ..I m actually more keen on seeing whether it’s worth spending 1800 USD on this or the one that SONY launches tomorrow.. let us know what you think of the crease.. the ageing and the true benefits of possessing a Google fold when you have Pixel 7A and Pixel 8 in line.
"That IPx8 rating is phenomenal for a foldable. That's pretty damn impressive.   
The hinges and thunk were immediately familiar as a Surface Duo user, and I really think that's a good comparison.   I'm pretty excited about it."
"Oh who's better to discuss Pixel Fold, than you, the Mr Mobile ! 
Good to hear it indeed does close flush, and has the IP68 and is able to hold various angles of clamshelling. Cool that they are trying to convince Android to cooperate with the squared proportions of this type of foldables. Great that the foldability finally doesn't come with traditional sacrifiices in the camera department.  And D-Brand's case with a kickstand looks cute."
I'm not moving from my duo until atleast 2024/25 but glad to see Google doing this and in a way looks for me very positive for the duo 3. That said like the look of this.
"Oh man! I really want that phone but it's too expensive for me even with a payment plan! It's exactly what I am looking for in a foldable, including not having a selfie camera on the inside that is a hole punch or under the display, messing up how things look while using it or making the screen fuzzy when it's hidden."
"Hey Mr Fisher
Great first look. Question. Isn't having a third selfie camera too much? I heard they made those bezels big to accommodate more space for that selfie camera. But why is it necessary to have it in the first place, there are already 2 camera's, does it really need a third? Especially if you can use the main camera as a selfie camera. I'd rather have smaller bezels and no selfie camera on the big screen. Curious what you think and I hope you'll open a discussion for this problem when your review comes out. Cheers"
"YES! FINALLY! 

Im in a market for a Foldable but it always fall short due to the Camera systems. Im using the Samsung S21 Ultra and I LOVE the zoom and samsung seem to cut back when it comes to their foldables."
Looks like a really nice phone! My dream is that this fancy new software and better support from third party apps can find their way into a device that has same dimensions as Oppo Find N that can be purchased in Europe
This excite me a little bit  because brands that actually sell devices in US might jump to start making foldables having an OS that is actually meant to be on a foldable
"Wow , I have three (3) takes on this phone
1. Finally Google making a foldable phone means the future is all about unfolding.
2. Apple has no choice at the moment, they have to join them....... they couldn't beat them. 
3. Apps like Instagram and Co would finally take folding phones seriously."
"I've been rocking the Find N2 for just over a month. I've been able to westernize pretty much everything about it (including WearOS pairing, Google Wallet payments), except for ""hey Google"" support. Not to mention it was hundreds of dollars less than the Pixel Fold will be.
Pixel features would be nice, but I don't think it's worth the tradeoff of slow charging, thick bezels, higher price and a deeper crease. Here's hoping many of the software improvements make it to Oppo."
Looking forward to seeing this in action in India
"It does look very nice. Now we have to wait for Z Fold 5, OnePlus V Fold and surface Duo 3 in USA"
This was the video I  was waiting for ever since the leak! Thank you for your service Mr Mobile
"Is Google about to pry me away from the iPhone? Because this looks incredible and I like how it looks way more than the Z-Fold. Especially when it have a similar profile to Oppo’s Find N, but the design language of the Pixel. I’d like to hear about repair options and maybe I’ll wait till a 2nd generation but… wow… I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t tempting"
not a big fan of the aspect ratio or screen bezels. but hopefully the fold 5 brings a lot more to the table
"Unlikely, but fingers crossed they make a clam shell fold for us who like small phones"
"Beautiful looking phone. I think it looks even better than the Fold. Unfortunately, after my repair experience with my Pixelbook, I can't bring myself to buy another Google hardware product. After the warranty ran out (by two days), there were no service centers and no spare parts, I was forced to buy a used MB off of eBay and figure it out myself. I'll just wait until a reliable hardware company like Samsung ""takes inspiration"" from them."
"Amazing video as always.

I would like to know what the quality of the cameras on both the zoom and wide angle compared to Samsung's z fold series"
Trading in my zfold 3 for it. I love my zfold 3 but the software annoys the hell out of me. I literally ordered the pixel fold within 3 minutes of its announcement. I can't wait to get it towards the end of June.
"I absolutely loved my Surface Duo, I even had the Gen 1 Damascus skin on it. I Got rid of it because it was too glitchy. I'm saddened that I was impatient and bought a Fold 4 and am stuck making payments on it."
"I'm excited, but I too concerns. 1. Can it only have two apps open? The Z fold can have three
2. Will they stand behind the screen? If it breaks, will they replace it without charging?"
I'm hoping this makes the foldable devices step up their camera and battery game..
Sweet looking device.  Hoping it takes off.  I've been looking for devices to trade in to take the sting out of that 1800 sticker price.
"Having a fold 3 and 4 (replaced the 3 with a 4 because of course....seam bubbles )...I super miss NOT having a fold. Its just so.... extra and not in a good way. They were so expensive and Im willing to bet almost no one would use its full potential (the ""extra"" part). I fully suggest anyone wanting a fold to really sit down and think before paying that extra money. Especially with inflation being what it is."
"I am glad Google entered the Market with the foldable ., but for the price it do not give me the wow factor and yes the bezels gives me an outdated feel and look. as for the App part hopefully google will have thinking out of the box approach and refined some current features that are in other phones on the market . The crase is not a major deal breaker but comparing what the Vivo and other phone manufactures have pulled off Hardware wise this a a step back ."
I really love the foldable concept but I'm still not convinced about its longevity and resistance.
"Cool, I'd love if they did a flip style phone!"
I don't personally like the wide screen instead of the tall form of my Fold. I'll still be looking for thr Fold 5 to be my next upgrade.
"Very cool. Super excited about Google getting into the fold community. As I watch this video on my DUO 1 I have to say I cannot go to a inside screen unless it's glass. Even though the DUO has the split, it's the glass inside that works for me. As a mechanic I constantly have grease, dirt and metal shavings on my fingers."
Came straight here to watch this and give you props for being THE AUTHORITY on foldables!!
Just watched Google I/O but I always wait to see the @MrMobile review first over everyone else's. 10 Min of my time to you Michel Fisher. Bravo!
"Guess this goes in the ring with the Pixel 7 and S23 for my next phone contender...S23 is currently $400 through Fi, so it's hard to justify $1,800."
"Modestly, Michael is the best phone reviewer out there! Thanks"
"Honestly what kept me from getting a Samsung Fold was the software limits. For as much money as I'm spending on a phone, I want to be able to get more than 2 years out of it. Won't be getting a Gen 1 Pixel Fold, but this keeps me intrigued to see if a foldable device will be my upgrade after my current Pixel 7."
Love to see the 5x cam on there! Hopefully Samsung follows suit.
"Interesting, can't wait to see the pixel flip"
Finally some good competition. We might start seeing prices lowering a bit!
"It's so refreshing to see an unbiased review of the new foldable, speacially when it's just a hand-on.
Most reviewers would be just happy to be invited and would praise the device no matter what."
Love the design. That’s a steep price tag though.
Huge bezels threw me off!! Looking forward to the Fold 5!!!
"Let the future folding phones feast in this fan favorite! 

I'm still going to wait until the second gen comes out!
Watching on my z flip 3!"
Thanks Michael. Great n fun video as always. Love the little extra nuggets of info that made such reviews uniquely yours.
YESSSSSSSS THE FOLDABLE KING IS SHOWING IT OFF!!!!
Exactly service support is the issue. Michael you're spot on
"FINALLY ANDROID-L WOULD BECOME GOOD 

Btw Mike, would you rate the Pixel fold's cameras over Find N2 & Vivo X fold's?"
"DUUUUDES this is gnarly AF. Prolly gonna be my first foldable once my Pixel 6A and Galaxy Tab A 2019 finally sh!t the bed (THIS THING WONT DIE!!!)  Was hoping for a Razr-like foldable from the great Googly-moogly, but I'll take it!"
I'll upgrade my zf3 to the zf5 this bezel is not my thing being used to small bezels on the zf3. Also prefer the inner screen on the samsung fold taller instead of wide
@MrMobile what was it like to use the keyboard on the pixel fold? Did you find the outer screen more or less usable that the z fold 4?
I'm so glad Foldables aren't just a fad like tablets were. I really hope this grows into its own product category like Wearables.
All I want is the next Galaxy Fold to have the S23 Ultra Camera and the hinge from Oppo.
"the only thing its missing, for me, is stylus support"
The software part alone is going to be huge for all foldable phones. Android will only get better with the form factor.
Huawei and Xiaomi are on another level. The Pixel Fold feels like a first gen product very much so.
"I couldn't get used to Pixel's poor battery life, regular UI bugs and clean, but very limited on features ""stock Android"" OS. The cameras were amazing but I like my S23U so much more  Glad to see foldables being mainstreamed by Google, though.  My next phone will likely be one of these bad boys."
"I just pre-ordered mine and depending on the call quality, I'll be trading in my fold 4. Can you please test the call quality? I traded in my pixel pro 6 because the call quality was awful. Hopefully they've improved it."
"Hey Michael - is the Find N2 fully useful now? No chinese apps, non-translated setting options etc.? I was waiting for Pixel Fold but it would cost in my currency like 8600 PLN while Find N2 woulc be like 5200 PLN. I would go fro Oppo... just please confirm if it is not annoying to use such non-international model?"
"Sooner waiting for this over Google’s key notes. 
Thank you.

1. I don’t mind about the bezels."
"I'm glad to see some U.S. competition in the foldable space.

I guess Google and Samsung will need to duke it out until Apple makes this a threeway foldable fight."
Looks great! Don't mind the bezels
"i'm not too keen on the landscape aspect ratio when opened it feel awkward to hold with one hand, but i love how wide it is when closed"
"Watching this on my Razr 5G, which I'm likely to keep for as long as it lasts, but very excited for the future of foldables! We're back, boys"
"Great look and design and software, glad to see Android really embrace the foldable space. 

Ridiculous price though, should be sub $1,500. It's first gen device, year old silicon, slow charging, no stylus support from a company renowned for dropping product lines at the drop of a hat..."
I'm using nothing phone 1 & I'm loving it I wish someday if nothing comes with foldable with cheaper options  I wish to buy pixel 7a but can't afford it
"This phone looks amazing, but the price is still a little prohibitive"
The find N is still the best size and best looking after all this time.
Awesome video as usual sir. Keep up the good work. Long-term subscriber here!
"I'd love to see how YouTube performs on this phone. My biggest gripe with foldables is that they keep getting Squarer rather than longer, so you loose more of a video on YouTube when cropped in. Does YouTube play well on this wide-screen? Or perhaps does it flip to ""horizontal"" when zoomed? Thank you!"
My only criticism is the price. I'm fine with the compromises like bigger bezels for the camera and the questionable hinge. For the same price you can get a 5th Gen Z fold this fall.️
Good coverage as always
This phone is amazing apart from the price and the bezel
"The best part is that it’s a Mr. Mobile video, the software, cameras, and tensor G2 chip, wish it was the G3 chip and at least a 8000mah battery two 4000mah cells on each side. 120hz displays on both inside and out is going to kill that little battery, would’ve been the best option for $1,800. Also stock Android is always good and smooth… That’s what she said"
Haven't been to this channel in a long time...Im buying the Pixel fold...BTW Pixel fold caes are already available on Amazon
Next fold we need to see is the apple fold. (If it ever comes)
I'll be excited to see the Pixel Fold 1a ;)
"Would love to have one, but I just can't morally drop 1800€/$ on a phone. Any shot of a Pixel Fold A coming?"
It’s so weird to me why google still don’t sell their phones in many european countries like here in Finland
This story about Google 'optimising Android for a form factor themselves' reminds me a lot about how they 'optimised' it for tablets ...
Does this device offer stylus support? I am always using for rough sketches and navigation on my Fold 3.
I really wish that they had built in a proper desktop mode like Dex or Motorola's ReadyFor.
The Pixel Fold is interesting but at such a hefty price tag do you believe it stands a chance at grabbing the foldable phone marketshare?
Just like the 6 Pro its will be best to wait until the 2nd gen of the foldable.
"295 trade for a 7? I was expecting the price, but that's a real punch in the gut. All my excitement was instantly deflated."
The landscape of folding phones will only change when Apple enters the market. They will be late to party but they will set the trend to follow.
Surface Duo with a flexible screen?! SOLD!! Hopefully Google will also copy the Duo's method for switching between multiple dual screen apps.
I knew he would be the one who would the happiest of the bunch for a foldable phone
Is there USB-C video output? During the I/O presentation the phone was plugged in so I am assuming they were using the connection for video output. I'm hoping they have not removed it in the production model.
"I'm gonna wait till Samsung drops its fold 5 before deciding on which fold to move to. If Samsung resolves its small outer screen problem, I'm pretty sure they can move ahead from Google since it's just a 1st generation fold against a 5th gen."
"""It's a surface duo with a folding screen"" yeeess! I've got a z fold 3 and surface duo to try out. The duo has a much better form factor, more satisfying in the hand I think."
it reminds me of Microsoft Duo 2 in terms of design.
"your video are the go to for tech, more pixel fold please in a review when its out. keep up the great work"
I’m so excited to see your first impressions and i cannot wait to see your personal review.
"Why have a inner selfie camera?  Just put the outer screen underneath the camera bar and move the wireless charger coil to the other side.  You would not only have better selfie pictures, but also potentially save cost by not having to put another camera and also have smaller bezels for the inner screen.  I never understood why foldables have never done this."
Always loved your reviews since day 1.. All the time GREAT! Keep safe my friend.
I think Google did good with this one.
"So many questions but my main one, and the deal breaker, is will it have alt mode/desktop mode?
""They're not a sponsor, they're a subject"""
"Please Michael make a head-to-head comparison between the Pixel Fold and the Samsung Z Fold 4 - thx ! And stay foldable, my friend :)"
"Its almost a perfect foldable phone, needs a better chip, less crease and bezels"
"The Pixel Fold might give some competition to Samsung. I love how the hinge closes the Pixel Fold than what the Fold Series gives

The $1800 price tag will make or break Google when it comes to making more of them."
"I can get 900 for my Fold 4 512GB, tempting. A little disappointed there is no macro mode on the camera, unless I missed that...."
"I want to buy this phone so bad, but the lack of pen support is a deal breaker. Google was stupid for not including pen support."
The only Pixel Fold video i need to watch. Great video .
Apart from the first razr this has to be the best looong foldable phone for me
You should have left their demo with Niagara as the default launcher.
The price is the only sore spot for me will probably wait for pixel fold 2 but at least Samsung will now have a competitor in the west
"If Google were really smart they'd make this phone $300 so then everyone would pick one up and join/pay for the Google ecosystem. Especially since Apple haven't made a foldable yet, I think that would sway a lot of Apple diehards."
Only foldable I genuinely care for
OK I like that Google is helping the foldable market but every software feature Michael talked about this pixel fold is already on the Samsung fold for literally years
What about a foldable watch? THAT could make me swap out my collection of EcoDrives for something more techy.
"Even though I'm not the target audience, I am curious of the device itself and wondering how well it performs and runs. Can't wait for the full review"
Would love Marques to do a video into the reality of long term ownership of foldable phones. From most forums it seems they’re not ready yet
"The bezel looks fine, it seems to work with that phone probably due to the screen size once opened, it doesn't feel like the bezel is reducing the screen significantly"
I love how Marques released this live while Google are presenting it at IO
"In my opinion given the design choice, specs and entire outlook of the folding phone landscape, google isn't gonna ship many of these pixel folds, it'll probably be in their second attempt that they see some improvement, provided they refine their approach, cause this fold is asking a lot for what it offers"
"Really wish we'd get that  dock on the normal pixels aswell without having super small scaling, it looks so useful for multitasking."
"I have a Fold 4 right now, it will be very interesting to see where Google takes this product line in the future!"
"That price rules it out for me, even with the ""free"" watch, I'll also be interested to see the battery life reports too"
"I've never liked extremely thin bezels on tablets, so this aspect is positive for me.

Tiny bezels may look great and function well on phones, but it's awkward when you have to use both hands on a larger device. I'm hoping the next generation will feature bezels of identical sizes on all four edges. Hopefully, they'll introduce a larger model as well."
"Also the Fold 4 has an option in settings to hide the bottom task bar (long press instead of swiping), similar to what you guys showed with the pixel fold. Very curious to see the durability of the pixel!"
I love how it's the same shape as the 3ds. I'm sure that you could emulate some 3ds or and ds game on this device really well
I like the design of the Pixel Fold. I'd love to use and test it to see how it performs in real life situations
"Hi Marques. First of all big fan of your videos and loads of love from India. 
I'd love to see a prominent youtuber like you and also others talk about the recent green/pink line issue faced by users across multiple countries using mobiles with led display from well-known manufacturers. It has become a widespread issue with no straightforward easy solution for the user who spends his hard earned money on these devices and do not always get even the acknowledgement from the manufacturers regarding this. I think when the tech community will start shedding light on this, it will be properly addressed and huge number of people will be relieved."
I love the Pixel 7Pro and the software experience but I cannot get past the $1800 price for the fold with not much more hardware or processing prowess. I think it's going to be a tough sell!
"LOVE how you banged out this video was so quickly. I would say it definitely looks impressive. As a person who has a Fold 3 and only rocks a Google Pixel 6 Pro because I LOVE the Google UI, Haptic feedback as well as the camera, I may have to scoop this up. I also LIKE the shorter/wider form factor compared to the longer/narrower one of the Fold series. Honestly it's either this or the OPPO Find N2(which I can get for cheaper here). Thanks again for the video."
"You should check out how the screen looked in the live demo at the Keynote, in the right lighting the crease on the screen is quite visible and it also kinda looked a lot more ""plasticy"" than the other foldables if that makes sense but not so much when you're looking at it straight on."
"Would actually love to give this a try but that price is nuts, I definitely prefer the form factor of this over the Z Fold 4"
"I think you are right about the price overshadowing the whole thing. It gave me pause, but only because it feels like price has been a pretty big motivating factor to get people into the pixel world. This is truly a product for fans of the Pixel software experience, but the price is too steep for me, even with a free a pixel watch. I am having a hard time justifying taking a dive into this foldable."
As someone who likes to read a lot on my phone (a Pixel 7 Pro) this layout would be absolutely perfect for me but the price is way too high. I'm still holding out for a more mid-range option in a couple of years.
"I like it. I love my 6A and honestly, if I see an iteration of this at $1000-$1200 in the future I am getting one for sure."
I’m really interested to see how Google will optimize apps for the phone.
"My gripe with the 7 pro is that its too tall for my small hands. I've never really considered a folding phone. But the ratio of the front screen looks perfect, and i can definitely see myself using the tablet mode for reading and online shopping. Definitely not getting the first gen, however xD"
"I'm planning to upgrade to the fold 5 when it comes out, right now the pixel fold seems like a really good first attempt but I don't see it beating out samsung, especially when it comes the price for what you're getting. I obviously haven't had hands on with the pixel but I imagine the one handed experience on the outside screen won't be as good, bezels are whatever to me I'd prefer to not have them that wide but it's not a deal breaker, like he pointed out battery is a little worrying, and I'm wondering what the durability will be like compared to the z fold. Maybe the fold 2 or 3 will blow samsung out of the water but currently they have the best software and experience with foldables on the market imho"
"It's gonna be a while before these phones become affordable. Would be interesting to see how this style of foldable phones evolves over the next few years. If they continue, that is. I really hope they do and eventually become something you can buy at the price of a normal phone today."
"As someone who has been with the Fold since the Fold 2 I've actually been very interested in this Pixel both for the Pixel software experience and for the more squat screen (though, truth be told, I'm now so used to the thin ""remote control"" shape of the Fold). I still think it's a very cool device but that price point for a 1st gen model is going ot be a tough sell against a 5th gen of the Samsung Fold later this summer. I'd also lose out on a lot of the Samsung ecosystem which, by design, was set to trap me in but it's honestly worked well and I appreciate using my other Samsung devices with my phone. On top of all that Samsung has aggresive trade in and promotion programs that will make the price of Pixel even tougher."
"Finally another real competitor in the global market for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series. Hopefully this pushes them to improve more on their foldables, and not just minor upgrades each year."
"I've been waiting for this phone for a while, been using the Z fold 2 and 4 but I hated the narrow outer screen. So, the wider outer screen on this phone is big welcome for me."
"Certainly intriguing!

Although the battery life is worrisome."
"For their first foldable, it looks pretty good. I haven’t read many of the other comments so I wouldn’t know what the general consensus would be. As for me though, i would buy it."
This obsession with thin bezels has introduced so many compromises that everyone has to work around. Hopefully they make a comeback and people realize it makes more sense.
"I like the concept, I think I want to see it mature and proven over a generation or two before I jump in. Probably going Pixel 8 Pro next."
How does video look in landscape with it open? This is probably my main drawback with exploring foldables--would love to hear anyones thoughts/experience on this?
"I am glad google released this, so hopefully we will get more software features specifically for foldables. Samsung added some decent features for foldable phone, but I am curious if having google make features will add even more features"
"Interesting, can't wait for the full review soon. Don't really mind the bezels as well but dang pretty pricey at $1799."
"I appreciate it simply because it is going to bring more support, familiarity and awareness to folding phones from a software standpoint. Every hat tossed into the folding ring brings down the price, makes it a more legitimate investment for devs and increases the odds that some day they might just be the norm. The day the iPhone Pro and iPad Mini are the same device is going to be a great one."
"That price is gonna be interesting. I think the Samsung folds have sold okay i sometimes see people with them in the wild but i don't see pixels as often tbh, and this is gonna be even more niche. I'm a bit confused why they didn't give it 16GB of ram tbh. I feel like if you're a folding phone that should be tbe standard."
This is an amazing first go for googles first fold. I always wait until the second or third gen though!
"Can't wait for the review. I am excited about it, but let's wait and see. Samsung is unfortunately frustrating us in the way of how slow they improve the z fold"
Honestly I'd be interested to see what Apple will do in the folding space. I use android but seeing like an inbetween of ios and ipad os would be interesting.
"I am on my third Pixel. I have had the 2XL, 4a and currently the 6 Pro. I will hold onto my Pro for at least another year. The fold might be tempting when it is time to switch. Hopefully the price drops a bit by then. 

I am actually back using my 4a right now, waiting for Google Fi to approve a screen repair for my 6 Pro."
"I tried the galaxy flip3 when it just came out and returned it as I'm not used with Andoid. Last year I tried the Galaxy Fold 4 and I fell in love with it. I think the reason behind is that I cannot compare the software to an iPhone as the Fold behave as a phone that turns into a tablet. Since then I been waiting for the Pixel Fold to come out. In my opinion with that price, I'm keeping my Fold4."
I can't wait to see a durability test for this
"The more I see the Pixel Fold, the more I like it. Would get it in white as I enjoyed the silver iPhone X I had before selling it after 2 months because battery life was so bad. I need to wait another 6 months to get the Pixel Fold at half the price or so. No way I'm paying $1,800 for it."
"While this is outside my price range, it seems to be a very nice.  One interesting comparison will be the price of this versus the combined price of a normal Google phone plus their upcoming tablet.

One thing I wonder about is Marques' influence over the perceived dislike of bezels.  Since I actually prefer bezels, I wonder if there are a lot of people who were essentially taught by Marques to think they are bad."
"It should of been $1,599 if they really wanted to make a dent against Samsung. I was excited for this but with the Fold 5 and the N2 under 1+ coming I'll definitely be holding off. Also Samsung trade in deals are nice and put a decent dent in that $1,800, I dont see Google matching those prices."
"I was considering switching to the Pixel Fold, but I just started working in a cabinet shop. I can't have that ""X"" in the IPX8 rating, that didn't work out too well for me when I got the first Pixel making granite countertops"
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
Was considering buying a small tablet has Cellular connection so I can take advantage of the free data sim for Fi. so if it makes this an all in one option then the premium price could make sense. Would have to see some more daily driver reviews to consider it though.
"even though I'm not too big on folding phone's, I love my pixel 7 and I think google making a folding phone may turn out quite well."
"I have a Fold 3 now and I really like the format, thin folded and square ish unfolded. These fat wild format foldables seem less comfy to hold it folded but haven't tried so who knows. The bezel definitely look weird."
The black one looks like a finger print magnet and that price point is outrageous. Its a good first attempt.  Im sticking with my Fold 4 though
I was so excited about the phone certainly seeing the great prices on offer for the 7a and tablet but once I saw the price I backed out I'll wait for the pixel 8 for my switch to pixel
battery life is gonna be an important part. I spent a year with the z flip 3 and the thing that always bothered me most was the battery life; and that phone didn't have a massive screen in the middle. switching from that into an iphone 14 was such an improvement when it came to battery life that i rarely have to think about it now. sooo idk for my money it's gotta have realllyyy good power optimization in order to make the battery last bc it almost doesn't matter how good the phone is otherwise
Awesome! I'm loving the Pixel line! I just hope they continue Pixelbook as well. The whole ecosystem is fantastic. Go Google!!!
"I like the pixel size better but if I was going to buy a foldable , I would probably buy the Z Fold.  It’s been tested and tried for a longer time and you can actually get it at a cheaper price, plus it has more flagship specs and we all know that when it comes to screens, well samsung makes the best ones and that is what a fold in the end is all about (i.e. media consumption)."
"The most interesting foldable to be honest!
Camera and display formfactor are the best compared to other foldable in the market."
$1800. That’s mad. Good to see some competition though. Looks a good bit of kit.
I like the design a lot and I love pixel software overall
"It looks very pocketable, so a good candidate to replace my Z Flip 3."
There needs to be a foldable with glass in the inside tablet screen with a foldable screen at the hinge and some bumpers on the side before they become useable and a good idea
Look forward to picking it up for 1/3 of the price in a couple of months once the fold 5 is out
i really wanna love this as it seems a bit better ergonomics then samsungs fold but for the same price im curious if it really does better overall. especially at that price. it is still cheaper to buy a phone and a tablet then one of these lol and im still not sure if id prefer this over an ipad mini or nexus 7/8. wish small tablets made a comeback!
Thinness is way more important than no bezels on a huge screen. Looks good!
"I would love if there was some sort of “try it for a week” program or something like that. I think a lot of people are interested in folding phones, but the price makes it a very tough pill to swallow if you don’t even know if you’ll like it. I think they’d sell a lot more of these if there was some way for people to try them out for a short trial period."
"Never used a foldable before, but I like stock Android and like the look of this. Will definitely be looking out for this as my second handset."
"Very first impressions: Those bezels (which I don't mind just didn't expect), second: it kind of reminds me of a Nexus 7 tablet which I dig but not into the market for phones rn basically just got my S22U which I am extremely happy with and this is above my price range of stuff I am interested in"
"I need to ask this here as well: I cannot wrap my head around this form factor. My understanding would be that the majority of people (but that comes from my viewpoint) would use the inner screen mostly as a nice big media consumption display while having a compact one-handleable (is that a word?) Folded form factor... Basically combining the best of both worlds. But for such usage, this inner almost square screen makes no sense as it only creates huge bars top and bottom. And even for multitasking I usually would imagine that a higher ratio would be better as you then can put 2 apps properly side-by-side... As you would do on a normal 16:9 (or 10) display. I was so excited for this phone but with this form factor I'm not sure I get an actual nice media consumption device after all."
"Personally, I am still on the fence about using a foldable as my daily driver, I feel foldables are still not refined enough. My wife's had a ZFold 3 for just under a year, she got onto the bandwagon for the phone and tablet being all in one but over time she just couldn't get over how think and heavy the thing is so now she's waiting for the Z Flip5 instead."
"I don't mind the bezels, as long as it is symmetrical top and bottom.

In fact, for this phone, the top and bottom bezels make the inner display feels more wide-screen rather than square."
"I can't wait to see where foldables go and how they develop over the coming years, it feels like the first proper development race between phone manufacturers in a long time, but in my personal opinion where they're at right now they're not worth the kinda money they're asking. A few years down the line however, when foldables are a ""normal"" phone size/thickness when folded, and are a decent tablet size when open, with minimal bezels, decent battery life and a durable screen, then i'm interested. But right now i'll stick with an Ultra or a Pro model over a foldable any day"
I think reliability will be the deciding factor on whether I will buy one. Interested to see how the failure rate pans out
"when considering price, how long of a support window does it get vs what you're comparing it too?
it makes a big difference if its a 3yr supported lifespan vs 5 or 6 yrs"
"If they offer crazy trade-in values like Samsung does with the Folds, I might just go back to Android. This fixes two of my biggest gripes with the Fold that I had: narrow front screen and poor foldable software (maybe)"
My next upgrade is between this and the Xperia V. Very impressed with this phone. First foldable I've seen that I'd consider buying.
"My bigger concern is how google talked about all these features they're ""working on"" bringing to the fold... Which, knowing how buggy Googles first generation of products always are, makes this a super hard sell for that price. Watch included. And Google is yet again murdering trade in values of their own phones. Pixel 7 Pro (at the time of checking) was only $400 trade in."
"As always with Pixels, the PFold 2 will be the one to invest in!"
Google dropped the ball with not starting this at $1400. Depending on reviews I may get one. I want to experience a new form factor and I don't mind being Google's test dummy lol
"So as a fold 4 owner this does look pretty good for a first attempt minus the bezels. They're offering $900 for trade in for a fold 4, but I don't know if I can trade for it especially with the fold 5 two months from now and outdated G2 chipset. I do like the slightly wider cover screen but I've gotten accustomed to the narrow candy bar fold 4 size which is so easy to hold. I'll wait for some reviews but probably wait for gen 2."
I have to say for $1800 from a pixel has to be pretty spectacular. They have made some super great products for some extremely low prices. I have high hopes
I truly enjoy foldables. Got the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 and now the Oppo Find N2 and I will never want to go back to a regular one.
"Design has always been my biggest issue with Pixel devices and this one is no different. The thick bezels remind me of 2018 and the rounded screen on a sharp edgy corner, when the phone is folded, seriously messes with my love for symmetry. I know it's subjective, curious to see what others say."
Can't wait for the actual review in theory this is exactly what I want I just hope it's realistic and works long term
"One of the main things people want to know about, and surprisingly you didn't mention it 

How is the crease with this design? Is it improved over other phones, or similar?  Is it worse?"
"I do think this is my favorite take on the folding phone. I also feel that its going to end up being the ""budget"" folding phone as pixel phones often go on drastic sales and if that continues for the fold, we could see it as low as $1400-$1500"
I like it a lot. It's great to see more foldable phones but for the price. No thank you. I was hoping this to be more like £1199
"This is the first folding phone I've ever had interest in so I'm excited, but I can't justify $1800 on any phone.  Maybe I will snag one if some deep discounts come in.  Personally I can't think of what a phone would have to do for me to be willing to spend $1800 on it.  I probably spend $3K to $5K a year on tech, but I know this phone will not be SIX TIMES better than the Pixel 6a which is my favorite phone of all time.  Even if I don't buy the Pixel 7a and a new Chromebook, I would still be $800+ off the cost of the Fold.  The Fold will also come with all of the negative trade-offs of a folding phone while on the other hand the 7a follows the formula I have loved for years.  I guess it all depends on what you prioritize in a phone.  My final thought is that if I were looking to buy a folding phone...  It would 100% be this one.  Or imagine $1800 for One UI???  XD"
"Marques either chose the backgrounds and angles of his shots very carefully, or Google finally solved the crease problem of folding screens. I think i saw a very slight crease in one shot, but other than that the crease is basically invisible."
"I didn't have a good experience with the Z fold 3, so I won't be getting this device but I am curious to see how it goes."
"So being on the S21 for a while and waiting for the foldable to get better is interesting! However, that price tag is a deal breaker for me. 
I really like the design. Being thinner than he Find N2 and lil bigger is excellent. I'm totally down with some pezel to get it thinner."
"This needs to come with a silicone keyboard to place ontop of the bottom inside screen, that would set it off perfectly"
"Amazing phone! 2 questions:

Is the back Glas glossy or frosted?"
Google is improving...but by making things more expensive.
My biggest concern about folding phones is the crease. Every folding phone I’ve seen has had an ugly notable increase across the screen. Fix that and I’ll consider the new form factor.
"I never expect folding phones to sell a lot but with that being said, I do think this one will sell pretty good"
"That's a lot of dough. Also, I guess the always unnamed but needed accessory for people who pay for these expensive phones would be a protective cover. I wonder how that would work with the folding mechanism?"
Still love the design of my duo 2 and I'm gonna stick with it until ms stops supporting it which seems to be very soon.  This looks intriguing but I still have tons of questions
Im kinda new to the Google Pixel Community and I wanted to buy a new phone this year. So I expected the Pixel 8 Series to get revealed in this IO since this is what I was reading everywhere. Will the Pixel 8 Series get revelead later or will there be no Pixel 8 Series in 2023?
"I've reaaally wanted a Pixel phone with the Oppo fold form factor but i don't know if I can justify the price, especially since it know it'll drop in value precipitously in just months. I might just wait."
What I would love to see Google do to really back their phone is include replacement warranty. Like include up to 4 repair/replacements in up to 36 months for $59 per request.
Definitely a competitor in the foldable line up.
Just a heads up! The dock is easily hidable and showable with a short press on the bar for Samsung foldable phones. Google did a very similar thing here.
"I trusted marquis as tech expert,i like everything about the pixel fold.the bezel makes the phone so charming.i can't wait to order and use it."
For 1800 they better be competing with full on desktop replacements. I was really hoping to upgrade my 6 pro
I cant wait for the full review. Its not worth quite that much money to me honestly. I want to give it a shot because foldables are interesting designs and forces devs to be quick to update software. The other thing is... google has the reputation of abandonware and id hate to spend 1800 on a phone where all the apps look awful due to poor design if they give up on it. food for thought
"That price is crazy, $1,800! Apple for sure is going to come out with their version and I wouldn't be surprised if they under cut this with something like $1499 and $1799 for the pro. I think Google is making a mistake with this price level...don't they read the news inflation is coming down haha"
"If battery life is good, I may hold out for a sale. Otherwise I'll be looking more closely at v2 of this. I love the pixel design and software"
"IMO, thick bezel is actually ok if it serves an actual function. It helps you hold the phone and manufacturers can put better hardware into it like better speakers, camera, e.t.c"
"Google is notorious for the sales, and discounts, they put on their phones right after launch. So I'm wondering if they're baking that into the price"
I actually like this form factor .. i wish samsung would make theres more wider as oppose to taller
"HEY NOW, might have to upgrade my fold 3 for this... but idk about that bezel on the inside, ugh and you hit the nail on the head! Need a good trade-in deal!"
"I just upgraded from a pixel 3 to a pixel 6. Once my current phone finally dies, I'm definitely gonna try to get the pixel fold 3 or 4 at that point, cuz I was planning on getting the Samsung Galaxy fold before I had to get the pixel 6 lol"
I want a fold so badddd. Just wish they weren't so outrageously expensive.
"I like how the ""Design Hardware Software"" matched the colours of the wallpaper on that laptop :)"
I hope next year we'll see Pixel Fold A that looks exactly like Surface Duo (2020)
Too expensive for me but looks good.
"I just went fold 4 to iPhone 14 pro max, haven’t had an iPhone since the 5. I think the folding fad is over now until they get much slimmer like a regular sized phone.  At least for me anyways. Also, even though the software is catching up to folding screens, it’s still not seamless."
I think considering other foldable phones i would get the best camera in the world for a phone obviously and the best android software in the world! It's a win win for me and 1800 bucks sounds alright for me i am definitely going to buy it as soon as it's available!
"At that price, it needs a desktop function like Dex. Wish that hot take would make it's way around so they can start implementing it. I can't afford either but if I were to choose, I would go Samsung for that reason."
"I'm very interested in the fixed fold but I just cannot justify a $1800 smartphone purchase, I do hope in the coming years foldables start becoming cheaper."
It is weird because the pixel fold is like phone i always wanted because it is small folded and big unfolded and is more than usable for me. But because of the high price I would like to wait another 1-2 generations to improve itself because for the price i can get a galaxy z fold4 and it feels like a better deal even though the pixel is what i waited for.
"After I have switched from pixel7 Pro to s23 Ultra and again I realised that the Samsung is not the best( so I don't say something much worse) for my personal use and really regret the Pixel,  for me it could be a good choice. For sure will not try Samsung for a while anways. But I will be waiting on a future review as I am not bothered with the preorder, as I got the watch last year and I don't like it esthetically on my wrist. To small for thicker wrists. So let's see what will become of this foldable in a few months until the Pixel 8 comes out"
I have a fold 3 and would be willing to try the pixel fold but they would need a chrome os experiance when hooked up to a monitor to compete with Dex and/or a stylus pen.   Currently it looks like a google version of of the folding microsoft phone.
I miss big bezels! Having somewhere to hold a phone was so nice.
Getting so many google phone notifications from all the creators
I think the bezel inside isn’t too bad reminds me of the iPad Pro bezel just wish it was a bit more uniform but not pretty decent
I think the price shouldn't be  priority one although that's how you'll be able sell your product I may not be able to afford it at the moment but I do love the design and honestly don't mind bezels - this was how they killed notification LEDs and proper selfie cameras to UDC.
"As someone who works in the cellphone industry. I can tell you the amount of folds and flips that go out the door even with trade ins taking $800 or even $1,000 off sometimes is slim to none. But I am excited to see how the support translates to Samsungs fold getting better."
"I think these kind of devices will have a good future, but for me they are not mature enough yet. Price, battery and durability will improve over time and personally that crease on the screen is still too disturbing."
I want it so bad but it's definitely outside of how much I'd be comfortable spending
"This is awesome
Version 2 is gonna kill it
Little bit taller for me like my fold 3 would be bice 
 but love this can't wait to get this phone"
Huh...I actually like the bezel?  I think it's a good way to make the hinge more durable while keeping the device slimmer.  It also lets you put a better camera in there.
"Im curious about the software optimization and how google gonna build android for foldable phone. But 1799 is just way too expensive. Right now u can get fold4 around 1400 and the hardware is definitely much better. Also if u can find somewhere to buy, xiaomi, honor and vivo all have foldable phone around 1100. For me 1399 and a free watch would be a rational price"
I like the look and definitely want one. But for sure waiting till the 2nd or even 3rd generation of it
"Glad to have a reviewer not being stupid about bezels, the bezels make this look so much better to me than the Z fold with tiny bezels which just cause more accidental touches."
"I will be preordering this immediately lol. My pixel 7 pro is ok, but I want something different and more useful for my current lifestyle and this is it."
The idea of a foldable phone from a company that made a phone where the camera lens can fall off is terrifying
It looks great for their first folding model
I think to make folables worth it for me. The hardware needs to be comparable to kkn folding phones and the crease has to go.
"I love my z fold, best phone I've ever had and totally worth it."
"Im calling it, its going to be a ""if only it didnt have this major issue it would be great"" kind of phone. Pixel always drops the ball on hardware"
"Marques, I had an interesting though where I considered the possibility that when companies send you and other creators their phones, they are sending you the best possible version so that you could make the best possible review - you could say that the phone is ""Creator Grade"".  Is it likely that companies would actually make something like that and ship slightly lower quality (by a small margin) devices?"
Probably not great out of the box but with updates could be awesome.
"That price is a tough pill for less battery than a non fold IMO. Im fine with the thick top/bottom bezels because of the hinge, but that shouldn't be a concern on the left/right sides. To me it seems like a ""Wait for gen 2"" or hope that they come out with an A model later that can kill the competition on price and be reachable by the general public."
Will the apps actually show more text on the screen? Or will it just be a resized experience?
"Well, I'm more excited now about what Apple's foldable phone will look like, because the designs of Apple phones are always a source of admiration for people, and the competitors end up copying them."
"My biggest thing with folding phones is the aspect ratio. I have a Pixel phone, I have a Pixel tablet (the original Pixel tablet, the Pixel-C from 2014), I mostly use my tablet to watch YouTube and other streaming services.

The appeal of a folding phone is that it unfolds to a tablet, but suppose the phone is a 16:9 screen, and now you unfold it and it becomes 16:9x2 ="
I hope we'll see Pixel Fold A that looks exactly like Surface Duo (2020)
I would wait for the second generation or see what Samsung's response is with their next verision. I just feel that the 1st version is risky. With that said I am really tempted by the Pixel Tablet.
"My 2023 Wishlist
1. Google Pixel Fold
2. Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"
Question is what is the primary camera sensor. It looks smaller than GN1 in Pixel 6/7 (pro). I hope someone can put imx989 in a foldable
I like the idea of this phone. The price is okay -for me - if it operates well. Screen quality/crease effect and battery life are questionable.
"Interesting enough, whenever I think about smartphone prices, I kind of imagine smartphones sales will eventually need to become similar to the console sales model, where the hardware is sold to consumers at a very low price or even discounted at a loss while the cost is quickly recouped from the sales of services (Play Store and Apple Store cuts on in-app purchases as well as cost for devs to put out apps on the stores has been paying back the price of phones with even lots of interest for years now....  Clearly manufacturers indirectly get paid as a result from exclusive deals like specific bloatware and default search engines, I wonder how that doesn't get mentioned often...)"
"It's looking pretty good, I know Google's got developers  that are going to create some custom ROM'S for this phone, and it's going to have features because of it that no other phone has already, and then with the custom ROM it's just going to kick the rest of the phone companies right in the ass, and this is their first generation of a fold phone and it's still going to kick the rest in the ass, it's looking pretty good."
"0:35 i love how to text colour matches the wallpaper on the laptop. 
This phone is priced far too high imo. In the uk its £1748 which is over $2200 USD. Even with the free pixel watch Google are giving for pre orders its still a bad deal. Also 1st gen tech usually sucks. It does look like a good device though and i have a Pixel 7 and Pixel buds pro, so i do like google products"
wow i was really contemplating on getting one of these but NOT for 1799 (with included pixel watch that i already own).. especially with last year's Tensor G2 in it..
The bezels on the inside are just too much for me to overlook. Not sure wth they were thinking. I do like the form factor though. Can't wait to see a comparison to z fold devices!
"I want it so bad, does anyone know when it might get released"
Like the form factor of pixel fold a lot more than my z fold 3 and am thinking of upgrading. Just Samsung software is better and the z fold 5 will have a better processor. Think google have concentrated too much on just the camera tbh
I like it. But that price though
Pixel

Nice video
Shut up and take my money!
Giannis!!!!!!!!
Does this new entrant in the folding phone market move the needle for you?
"I had a Galaxy Fold 2, but I switched back to a standard S22 Ultra after a nightmare with customer support. For $2000, it shouldn't be bad!

Though tbh, I dont think I'll be buying another smartphone anytime soon. I'll probably just root a Pixel if I need a smartphone after Samsung eventually ends OS updates for my phone."
I will wait for this to go on sale like most other google phones usually do
This one's looking terrible at the moment but I'm glad they entered this space. This year's Fold 5 should have even better software support now that even Google has officially released a folding phone.
"The more I see the Pixel Fold, the more I like it. Would get it in white as I enjoyed the silver iPhone X I had before selling it after 2 months because battery life was so bad. I need to wait another 6 months to get the Pixel Fold at half the price or so. No way I'm paying $1,800 for this. I'm still paying off my Flip 3 from 2 years ago for another year.

Google needs to push for trade-in deals. The reason I like it is because it's small when closed like a Find N and N2. The big bezels don't really bother me. I'm hoping Zvelsiem makes a faux leather case for it. Covers the hinge completely. I really enjoy the feel of their cases. They're usually out of stock with their Z Fold/Flip cases.

On AT&T, they're very selective with which phones working on their 5G network. I can't import an Oppo Find N2 or vivo X Flip. My only foldable choices are really from Samsung and maybe Motorola. At least Pixel Fold offers a different alternative for those who don't want Samsung. This is really what the Surface Duo 1 and 2 should've been.

This Pixel Fold was delayed for nearly 2 years. It was supposed to come out in late-2021 but Google focused pushing the Pixel 6 series more. I guess it was worth the wait like Top Gun: Maverick."
"The hinge, those bezels and that bumper case, I am getting heavy surface duo vibes"
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
"Can’t wait for the siefert deep dives to come! Not into foldables, but intrigued by the possibilities."
"I like the idea and in some cases the execution of foldable phones a lot - but. I fail to see how such a thing would work for me - in function, daily."
"Can't believe Google made a better fold on their first try than Samsung. That form factor is just perfect 
But definitely skip this first gen and wait for next year."
"I'm an iPhone user for over 15 years now, first time i've been truly impressed by an Android phone."
Add Slim Pen support and this is what the Surface Duo should have been.
This at $1800 has the same processor as the $500 7a. Does that make the 7a a better deal or the Pixel Fold a worse deal?
I’ll wait until gen 2 before I decide if I’d get one. First gen seems impressive tho
No stylus! Thats crazy for foldable phones.
Finally some competition!!
It's the Surface Duo but with a foldable display and no pen input. Hopefully Microsoft does this for the Duo 3 but includes pen input and I'll get it. No pen input no go.
The cameraman in the background of the selfie camera shot at 4:27 is the unsung hero of this video...
"thank you for the side by side
the numbers are smaller but side by side bigger pretty cool"
Love it! But i genuinely would like one a little bigger phone .
"I would use competition pretty lightly. The processor is a little dated for the price, Vanilla OS is not as great as everyone makes it. The price is too high when 2-3 months later, we will have the next Galaxy Fold rocking the 8 Gen 2. The battery is also very worrisome when the current Tensor Chip has been proven to be average at best. I think the only think that it has going for it is the thinner body, maybe the camera? and wider screen."
I like googles ecosystem but if i were to get a foldable i would rather have samsung fold 5. After a few years maybe id consider the pixel fold. By then it should have better improvements. I guess it comes to first gen or 5th gen.
Great review.
Good grief. A decent gaming desktop now costs a bit over $3000 while the top-end flagship phones go for a bit under $2000. This is simply nuts. The world has gone insane.
Watch how this gets dropped by Google in a few years just like any other Google product.
"With the Exynos processor it uses, the battery is gonna last half a day"
we need more videos with Dan
These folds need to go down on price
I love this phone man I wont buy it for moral reasons with todays manufacturing human rights violations but its awesome to see how far tech has come
google and samsung need to learn how to make a display like Oppo
IF you spend $1700 on a phone you should spend $200 on a phone and donate $1500 to your local homeless shelter or food bank.
"for the money, no stylus is insane. broke the deal for me, even if I was not happy about the price."
For $1700 it better fold into a car too
"I'll get a foldable display when the display or hinge outlast the 3-5 software support for the phone.

After a year or two the display has micro cracks or competly unusable in the middle."
That’s thinner than I expected
Fantastic. Finally I can ditch my fold 3 and go back to the Pixel ecosystem.
Those bezels...
Finally
it’s like oppo folding phone.
I'm interested in the flip phones but the I can't overlook the gross crease
Too bad google didn't price it to compete with Samsung
Worth it for $1800?????
1799 on a phone with plastic screens? no thanks! i will pacefully wait for this technology to grow
There is more than only Samsung
Will it work with Backbone?
Wow that cheap at $1800
Not the best looking folding phone. I will wait for the 2nd gen
"Come on  a 1st gen Pixel Fold certainly won't challenge Samsungs 5th gen Fold, Google has only just come into the game so maybe in the next generation but certainly not this one."
Wait they didn't announce this yet
Remember the golden rule of new Google hardware: never buy the first generation
No stylus? No thanks. My last Google hardware was Stadia. My Fold4 does everything I need it to
"wait for thanksgiving, it will be sold for $800"
Amazing sound
Is there a reason why the bezel of the inside screen is sooo f*** big?
So is the verge just hiring ex CNET employees now???
IT COSTS HOW MUCH!?
They DON'T have competition. The price of the Pixel Fold is RIDICULOUS! It's a firm NO from me.
Foldy woldy wooo
$1800…no thanks
"30w charging is sad, google phoned this one in. And no stylus. Meh, pass for me."
This is not even in the same league as the GZF4  even the software on this looks unfinished. Samsung has 4 years of R&D advantage at this point and it shows. Google has released this just for the heck of competing.
Google lost me on the fold once the showed the $1800 price.
remember when phones were considered to be expensive when it's $899? LOL 1800 what a joke
Those bezels are hideous.
You lost me at the price unless they give me a hefty trade-in for my previous phone. I don't see myself getting one of these things.
Getting Matt Lucas vibes (Little Britain)
I think this was released early
Am I the only one who doesn't like the launcher color?
"Dat stutter on the Z fold on the side to side comparison, oof. Get’n Samsung’d"
"If it's got a crease, I'm not interested. And it most definitely has."
I stopped watching at the price
This phone will be $799 by the end of the year lol.
Still a useless gimmick
Way way WAY overpriced.
"Really google, 2023 with that bezel...."
That's it I'm moving to iPhone
Pixel Fold = Lame Design with thick chunky Top & Bottom bezels and big Camera bulge. Redundent gimmick phone with last year Tensor G2 chip and specs. Thanks but no Thanks
Competition? Not even the same ball park regarding the screens
First
OMG GOOGLE THE SCREEN CREASE IS VISIBLE FROM SPACE
I'm so impressed with how fluid and versatile it is. Well done
"That rear camera module design looks so good, I hope they put it on the upcoming pixels"
"For the price, I expected the Tensor G3 to make it's debut. Also maybe quad speaker?
For the rest of the hardware, it looks amazing."
Pretty impressive multitasking features
I am surprised there isn't any stylus. Looks beautiful
"Was totally stoked even knowing the price until today. I'll probably still begrudgingly purchase, but 295 trade for a Pixel 7 does nothing but highlight how fast Pixel value drops"
The most impressive piece of hardware i've seen in a while...
"Was thinking of pre-ordering it and trading in my Pixel 7 Pro, but then I did a comparison of the camera specs and thought maybe not. Also it's really really overpriced, just like Samsung's fold. There's zero chance of me paying that much for downgraded cameras and unknown durability, plus a tiny battery. I was expecting Google to be aggressive on the pricing because of the compromises involved in buying this product, but disappointingly they weren't. If they'd knocked off the price of the watch and given me a trade in discount to make the price reasonable, then I'd consider it."
"Fantastic, as expected!"
"I'm glad they brought Frosted glass back. 
I'm hoping Pixel 8 will have it next."
Nice work. It's like three pixel 7's in one
It looks stunning but I dare not even look at the price!
Missed the chance for a stylus. Also I like how they aren't scared to show the translator isn't perfect.
Hope the Canadian market release comes. Was looking forward to this but it looks like I'll be waiting a while :(
Looks like this will be my first Google Device
I just pre-ordered mine soooooooo excited!!!!!
"That's the phone I've been waiting for, and I've been waiting for a long time!"
I want it ...and I believe it's important to support the Fold...but my wallet is saying to wait for the 8 Pro.
"Samsung better end their complacency because Google has now entered the foldable market with top tier cameras and periscope zoom in the United States.

Competition will benefit us consumers and I say that as a S23 Ultra user."
Let's gooo. Raising the bar on foldable devices!
Ok that real time translator function is pretty neat
"I was really anxious of seeing this and of course getting it but, really disappointed it's not coming to Canada..."
the only thing I like more than the others is the screen aspect ratio
"My P5 is near enough at deaths door (had it for 3 years) and I was holding out to buy a new phone. Not sure whether to wait for this (i love niche stuff) or just pull the trigger on P7P

Thoughts?"
Google pulling out all of the stops. Impressive!
"One reason I want a fold phone is for productivity, does the phone have a desktop mode when docked so it can replace my work laptop?"
Insane!
Awesome. too pricey. i was hoping it was more like 1200
"hope google store will expand to croatia, i really love pixel phones"
"Considering the battery of the pixel 7pro with the tensor g2, this one with two screens ... let's hope it arrives by lunchtime"
Oh God! This multi screen translation function opens a new horizon for foldable devices.
Drag & Drop looks really nice to work with!
Google solved the folding screen conundrum Samsung can't seem to fix on their Galaxy Fold phones. Well done Google!
Very good video presentation! Top level
It's sad Google is not releasing in Australia.
$1800 is insane for something like this.
Please start distributing the Pixel on México already!
Hope it's available in india
I need a promise that this one wont boil my screen.
Can you make it available through the Canadian store? Thank you
"Woow this is so awesome, will you guys als proceed with hub 3?"
Best foldable phone i ever seen hard and soft goes in perfect harmony
Watching it even though I can't afford it
What about the 8 series?
"Здравствуйте, дорогая корпорация добра! Любллю все ваши устройства за их безупречные функции и лучшую производительность при соотносительно невысокой цене. А так же, как считаю я, лучшую камеру на рынке смартфонов(огрызок яблока - простонервно курит в стороне).
Пишу это сообщение для того чтобы спросить вас конкретно, не расяитывая на обратную связь, но всё-таки, - когда и как купить такой произведение искусства как Pixel Fold находясь в России?"
"Would never give you my money, but the live translation looks amazing"
Will he get one of them from Google as a token of friendship
For the love of God SEE THIS PROJECT THROUGH! You tend to can a lot of projects…one reason I don’t invest heavily in Google products.
there's no way it's 3 days battery life ?!
"When regular premium is not enough, you get “Ultra Premium“. Good old capitalism"
"I cant believe this is so freaking awesome, count in, Google! Ima buy it SOON!"

"Looks great, but I was hoping Google would undercut the market, not match them.
Still tempted."
Geez I really hope I made the right choice
"Always wanted a pixel fold and tablet but it's not a good time to release them, the playing field is different than it was in 2022 and the yrs prior. Pixels also don't even have freeform windows multitasking. I just hope these won't be abandoned if they don't sell well"
I cannot wait to see what Apple will  do ?
Google does it again
When is it releasing in Australia?
Does it have wireless charging?
When is it expected to arrive in India
Great Foldable..........the price......not so much!!!!!!!
#teampixel love you from badin Sindh Pakistan ️

"Really , Google is so perfect bro, I wanna a pixel Fold please"
Is this the first Pixel not available in Canada?
Disappointment there’s no pen support. Was so ready to leave iPhone and iPad
Wow this is advanced fold phone . Wow fantastic. What ever it take I own it.
Finally Perfect
Annoyed this is not coming to Australia. Unbelievable
Ok Android 13L optimization seems good and interesting
Is there a desktop mode or like Samsung DEX?
hmm still watch this space for me.. being a fold user for 2 generations kind of think fold 5 maybe the way go
It will be amazing
#TeamPixel ️
"YES.
LOVE THE DESIGN
THANK YOU GOOGLE"
What is the plan to make it available in Malaysian Market?
I want buy one but not available on my country.
Still think foldables are useless  for me imo
But unavailable in India
What about the PIXEL 8 series!!??
Hmm...Looking Wow
for that amount of money a bezel like that is scandalous
I can't wait for JerryRig to let us see how that sexy hinge works

Z fold user here. I'm switching as soon as this is available. Samsung ecosystem is trash and I've been waiting for a device to switch to. The user interface they force on us is like force feeding me internet explorer in 2039
"1800 bucks, oof.. it's like they don't want to sell too many, as it makes them no money... statement, nothing more"

"hope you enjoyed this different, sit down & talk video. was kind of freeing to not rely on a script, ahaha."
"It looks a bit, ""prototype-y"" but I kinda like it and I'm interested in it as much as with the Pixel Tablet.

I hope they focus on making the UI easily fit both normal displays and wide displays (for example by replacing popup screens from the bottom and make them popup at the center) and also push developers to fit their apps UI for tablets and foldables."
"Foldable prices are ridiculous. For $1800 USD , I would rather buy myself a nice 4k TV or a massively better laptop than my 12 year old HP m6. Unless they become the only phone option, I really don't see myself getting one"
"Well, if it's going to cost as much as two 7 Pro's, it should have 2x processors and batteries.I bought the 7 Pro 512 as soon as it was released (Ordered October 6, 2022 and paid $1187.47 with tax). I like the camera much better than my previous Note 20 Ultra although the battery life isn't that great with either."
"The weight is about the same as the Surface Duo 2's, which I found fine. Hoping the rumors about the price aren't true, though. Heard different ones that it's more like $1400. If they're throwing in a free Pixel Watch, that eases the sting some since I'm just going to sell it."
"Without trade-ins, or a sale;  Z Fold 4 here in Canada, is going for 2500-2800 (CA) Insane!!"
I thought it was announcing in may at Google IO and shipping around June

"This video is so good that Im stealing this footage

Yeah google really needs to bump up the power and performance on the pixel 8 series.
This should be a great upgrade from my pixel 6!
"Screw the OUTSIDE SCREEN. WHAT ABOUT those inside BEZELS. And the chip set, the level of bugs on their own devices, etc.?"
When you said rye price I just spat my tea out!
And the G2 might perform ok. But the worry for me would be battery life. As the Pixel 7 Pro is shite.
Yea that Tensor 2 Googles software isn't gonna be enough for this phone. I can see heating and battery issues. 2 Screens I mean. ️
I believe it's better we focus on our core competence and workaround to address a bug free environment. The core issue with foldable is that niether its a viable project nor it attract the attention of people .screen aspect ratio bulky product hinges crease weight costing there are endless issues surrounding to the concept so its better come up with some innovative concept that will take the journey of end users to next level .
"To answer the question you asked 53 seconds in, you clearly meant ""foray"" - meaning to venture into an enemy's territory. You used the word ""foyer"", a word meaning a lobby. The pronunciation you used is closer to the original French word or the way the Brits say it.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxwmPYf2riw"
The Google fold is for the rich and not for the average consumer.
from. Where can I get this background
"I want to see all the software features that Google has implemented with this fold. I bet they did a great job since they control the hardware and their software as they intended it to be, but $1799 is hard to swallow."
I’m actually really excited for this. I love the fold but wish it was a little wider on the main screen and I miss the software of my pixel 6 so will be happily getting this. Especially if it comes with a pixel watch
Loved this format Jon! The way you presented the images and the specs. Great look and sounds. Keep it up! Fah Pah Tah!
"If Sammy's first fold was north of $2k, I would say it was not worth it.
But; you can only put a value on something if its capabilities are valuable to you.
PS. Thanks for spilling the Chilli, and yes, I am getting one."
I’ve kept the belief that the Oppo Find N has been the best designed foldable and hoped that an American company would copy it. This seems to be what everyone has been waiting for when it comes to foldables.
"Great info Jon but I think Google missed a trick with the pricing 
Samsung has a track record of foldable phones and I think people would opt for that as they’ve no idea how this would perform."
"The specs sound great, though the price is pretty high.  Hopefully that's an early adopter premium.   I will wait to see if prices drop after a few months."
"First gen products are bound to be the buggy ones especially for this one since google hasnt really developed the os to handle folding screens/orientations well.

But i still hope this product succeeds (despite any bugs or rough patches) because samsung needs competition and to bring down their prices. Not just in “oh it costs too much for me” but more for the sense that theres no competing version in america and thus samsung can keep selling it at 1.8k. Meanwhile the asia versions are much cheaper because the quality is different but also because they are all competing with each other."
I think adding a Pixel watch to the package really makes it easier to consider! Smart move on Google for a new product from them at a high price. It looks and sounds sweet! If only Apple ever made a folding phone. :(
"Overall I would say the safe bet would probably of course be to wait till reviews come out and see what is said. And then of course wait and see what Samsung does. Samsung with more experience and being the 5th iteration, on top of that with added competition I would expect have a strong possibility to be a strong competitor in performance but especially price."
"The visuals look so nice!! I love the editing you did there, amazing job"
"You guys said everything except water resistance!! I upgraded to the fold 3 because it's water resistant, and I'm not willing to take chances on $1800 if I can't have that kind of reassurance."
"Glad you cleared it up, haha !
Can you do the same for the Pixel 7a ?
I'm curious because there are so many conflicted reports about specs, mainly about the camera ! 
Thanks !"
If it really does come with a watch then yes I think that's worth it. I might even consider that rather than the normal phone this year since I was in the market for a watch
"Eager to see if anyone can challenge Samsung in the ""folding phone"" category.

Can't be worse than the Surface Duo 2 at least"
I hope it has stylus support for us artist/designers if so that would be great. Imagine if Google also paid ProCreate to bring it to the pixel fold  that’s a dream though lol
Awesome Jern! Only one question did remain somehow after this one... Does it support wireless charging?!
"I still have question. I've been a fold 3 / fold 4 user for a few years now... I love DeX mode as it allows me to leave my work laptop at home and ""dock"" when I get to work. The Pixel series do not currently allow USB-C video out. If the Pixel Fold doesn't support USB-C video out and some sort of desktop mode, then this would be a fail for my use case. If they do.... I could be very tempted to try one. Do you know if this is a feature, please?"
"Google likes to have sales. I'll wait for the Black Friday sale. Also, thank you for giving the actual phone dimensions at the end."
I wish the optical zoom was 10x. I actually wish Samsung put it on the Fold 4. Will this Google Fold be compatible with a stylus?
I love that it folds flat but the price is still wild.
"I really want this phone bad. I was a die hard Google fan up until the foldable phones came out.....  I just got my Z Fold 4 last year. I've chosen to upgrade every 2 years due to the price. However If Google offers 1k+ trade in for the Z fold 4 I might just do it...... I really dislike the front screen on the fold 4.  Anyway thanks for sharing these specs, very helpful...... Also the Tensor G2 vs the SnapDragon 8 Gen 1. Come on google!!!!"
"All I want to know now is will this push the iPhone folding device to this year? I’ve been holding out for a folding iPhone for ages but my 11 pro is giving up, gonna have to bite the bullet soon"
Is there going to be an optional stylus as an accessory to use with it like the Z Fold from Samsung?
"Been eagerly waiting for this one, but now my question is if it is going to be left out cold on the photography department by the incoming Xiaomi Mix 3, which is using the Xiaomi 13 Ultra setup."
I’m more excited that Google will have some skin in the foldable game. Hopefully this will lead to more baked in software tricks and polish to the idea as a whole.
If you listen really carefully you can hear Sundar Pichai screaming all the way in California right now.
"Received a Pixel 7 cutesy of Google Pixel Superfans last year hoping the luck continues with the fold this year, I’ve wanted this device for so long!"
I like this faster pace commentary with small comedic additions and information very neatly displayed in the video. Just saying if you find this useful.
This guys more of a killer google leaker than anything apple
It's funny how I love hearing about all the leaks and rumors but I cant help but feel disappointed to basically be told all of it at once because it kind of removes the wonder and mystery of it all
This guy is simply entertaining regardless if he’s leaking anything or not
Great breakdown. I love this channel especially since you get in and get out. Is it worth 1799? No phone is to me
Can someone explain how good the Zoom is going to be compared to the Z fold 4? I think the Z fold 4 gets up to 30x zoom and this will get up to 20x Zoom? Am I getting that right?
I won't be getting one yet I am going to wait for the second gen pixel fold as the bezels in the inner screen are two big for me to pay $1799
"Looks better than fold IMO, and that it will be more easy to use as a foldable. But for that price, there needs to be some killer features the fold and other pixels don’t have. Cameras aren’t looking exciting."
I was looking forward to the pixel fold since I first heard about it.
I'm definitely waiting for the fold 2
For a first Gen this is impressive. Now how well it performs is TBD. Now at that price will it sell? In a word yes it will. How well in the depressed economy is the $1799.99 question.
"I'll be preordering as soon as possible. Although I don't need the Pixel Watch, I already have one"
"I want this phone so bad if it wasn't 1800 dollars. Throwing in a Pixel Watch does soften the blow honestly, just not enough unless my S22 trade in has a huge bonus

I paid 350 for my S22 3 months after launch"
Will all depend on how aggressive they are with Fold 4 trade ins
"YES, this is called leak, news, information packed… Top-notch video!!! Diversify your content... LessGooo"
Jon you leaked this way way back before anybody else so does this mean you have finally ascended again? It’s been awhile but I think this qualifies
"The center fold has to be absolutely creaseless before I buy a foldable. Battery life, storage, performance, software and camera quality are all important factors as well, but the crease will continue to keep me from buying a foldable."
Worth more than anynother fold/ flip device out there
Wow. I'm ordering him with the markup on that phone's going to be when it reaches Canada. It's going to be crazy expensive
Ive finally found this channel again im so happy
Damn it. I am a huge Pixel fanboy! I have owned every Pixel XL and Pro... But that price is steep.
"Personally, probably gonna preorder. Current Fold 4 user and I love everything but the front screen. Every message I type needs corrections and that got old real fast. I will miss the S pen though, and DEX although using that is admittedly rare"
Any info on the hinge being used ? There’s a few different ones around now
Any info on pixel Watch 2. Like a bigger one hopefully
"Wow that’s really everything. 

And yes, I’m definitely buying."
"Not going to lie, I really want this, but they're gonna have to offer me like $1500 for my pixel 6 trade-in for me to jump on this boat it's first go round lol"
For that price on the 512 version the could've developed a unique colour.
"Man we just need an Oppo Find N2 with an international vanilla Android rom at its current price, job done."
"I'll get this after the pixel fold 2 comes out used or refurbished ,  too expensive for a fragile device"
"Oh ""yeah, when it comes out, I hope Google release the source codes, so we can make some custom Roms."
Can't get over the thick bezel inside
There's no way they're beating Samsung's 4th gen foldables with such prices
"Since the Nexus line of phones the tech community was complaining about how they would love stock Android on Samsung hardware, although One UI has come a long way since those days, I believe many still want stock Android on Samsung quality hardware. Now Google has finally come to that point and people still complaining about the price, it's still a few hundred cheaper than the Galaxy Fold series."
"John what about country availability, which countries are in the list?"
I missed the exclusives hope to see more
Google drop all these affordable phones now skip straight to the ridiculous
"Is it worth it? Probably. Will I spend $1800? No. Will I still get one? Trade in willing, absolutely. Hoping my carrier has at least a $800 to $1000 trade in for it. But as I just got a 7Pro less than a year ago, I'll wait a few months when the price begins to drop."
"That was a lot of camera experimentation, I like it :)
GIMME MOOOORREEEEEEEE"
"I think that the price is going to hurt sales on this a lot. Even with a free pixel watch i would not buy this 1st gen foldable by google, and thats from someone who really likes my pixel 7"
Worth it if it takes pictures like a regular Pixel
Bring on the Best Buy Black Friday sales!
Project soli better be in them massive inside bezels at least they would have a function
"nice stuff Jern, always happy to see your leak shiz."
I like it. But samsung is already coming into the gen 5 fold in a few months' time with better specs. Gonna see how it goes.
"The teaser happened, and I loved it."
"Finally, something other than Apple stuff. You get a like."
I'll wait for it to be £300 used in a 18 months like all other foldables.
"I like the Fold 4 and what its capable of, but I hope the Pixel Fold is as good if not better

The Z Fold Series is the true definition of a phablet.......and the Pixel Fold should add to that"
I held on to my z fold 2 waiting on this one. I'll take it
"Thanks for all the info!
Does it have wireless fast charging?"
Does the front selfie camera video record 4k or is it 1080p?
I will be preordering!
Hope Apple make a foldable. That would be epic
I want to know what is the hinge they use for the fold out
It’s not worth it Jon unless it’s gives 2 days battery life. I like that you get a small iPad screen with phone but good battery is what would make me thing about getting this unit
looks nice but idk compared to the galaxy fold 4 or even fold 5 coming out idk if the price is worth it
Only if they use Tensor G3 I will consider buying at that price. Will 100% skip for fold 5 with a better chip.
"At the price point they are competing at I want no compromise. I'm happy that I went with the pixel 7 and not the Pro because I would have been sick paying 1k for a Tensor G2 chip. It's smooth until you throw a full workload onto it and then it feels slow. Multitasking is ok at best and nonfunctional at worst, but the camera still can't handle 4k 60 fps video. Everything else about the phone is flawless but I need more power epically if they want me to pay top dollar."
"Given Google's track record of rolling out meh hardware with buggy AF software (and considering they can't really claim timely security updates anymore) this is more likely a wait & see/grab it 45 days after release at $300-$500 off type of decision. At these prices, they need something pretty compelling. Otherwise, why wouldn't a foldable consumer just go with the Galaxy?"
"Why is this episode so organized and big brain and - not the chaotic mess that i love and crave, hm?  America explain!"
"I still have an opinion that foldable is still out of reach for general consumer as it simply lacks the display reliability and the cost and the real need of it over traditional brick phones and the main thing,  cost of buying it and repair"
"Foldables will never be worth it till two things happens:

1. I can afford one
2. The crease feel and visibility improves MASSIVELY!!"
Buying it. I love my Fold 4 but stick with a fold. Getting it
Tensor g2 is definitely a bottleneck for this
I think it's worth it. If I didn't already have the pixel 7 pro I would be picking this up
"I hope the Pixel Fold has fewer failures than the Z Fold has. Although, Pixels lately have had plenty of their own failures. Even if I could afford it, I'm not spending $2000 on something I could drop and break, or lose at a restaurant.I would not even pay that for a 75"" TV."
interesting to see what those trades look like
"I’m definitely interested in this device, but water resistance on a folding device and can’t be so Sammy gets mine money"
The Pixel Fold with the Pixel Watch makes a great combo.
They might also throw in the pixel buds i suspect..
"People pay the same for iPhones that look like and feel the same as last year's model, so why not get a Pixel Fold instead. Looks pretty awesome."
Sundar Pichai is absolutely seething right now
will john get hired to announce it on stage and this is practice time?
"I'm excited about the Pixel Fold, but only because GrapheneOS said they plan on adding support for the Fold and Tablet"
"Pretty normal for first gen to be expensive, Samsung did it with their first fold too."
The pixel watch isn’t free . It’s already factored into the exuberant price of the Google fold.
I'll assume charging speed is still at 2018 speeds?
Doesn't actually sound like it be too bad of a foldable.  I guess time will tell
"It must have an integrated 4090 graphics card to be worth that much 

Honestly I don't pay more than 1000 euros for any mobile and it already seems too much to me"
Risky getting a first gen of this for that kind of money even from google.
"It's annoying. I know this won't sell great and Google will axe it. As they have pretty much everything that's not immediately successful. I'm watching this on my Z Fold 3, and it's still going strong. While I like folding phones, I don't think they are the future. I think it's similar to PDA's and really help those who need to multitask and use their phones for work. I'm constant using multi window to pull up spreadsheets and emails while doing research, etc. The pen is an added bonus and helps productivity as well."
Worth it only if it actually comes with a free pixel watch
how many mAH battery does it have?
"I WAS THIRSTY FOR A LEAK LIKE THIS!

thanks my man"
I wonder how it match huawei mate x3.
$1700 usd for the same camera and chipset for which you can get a pixel 7 unfoldable for $499-$599 Cad. If google does not decrease the prices this pixel folds are not going to get sold.
I'm already considering buying the Fold 2. Never buy a first gen of a tech product
Definitely not a 1st Gen folding phone from google. I’ll probably pick up a Pixel 8 Pro in the fall.
What is a use case for half a terabyte of storage on a phone/pad???
Pass! I’m waiting for the Z Fold 5. Can’t beat those trade in deals Sammy has on preorder.
"Given Google's consistent inability to create a tablet UI that isn't complete rubbish, I doubt that this is going to be a stellar experience for a new product release. People are about to be severely disappointed in their $2,000 ""investment"" on this one."
"It's funny that here in US, pricing is so  deceiving, that 1799 costs probably 1950 with taxes, price should be inclusive of taxes"
now i got a question : what’s the point of google doing a whole event for this phone every thing in it is leaked even the existing teaser date.
$1800 for a foldable device is reasonable
I still can't believe google actually did it.
"No mention of water or dust resistance

 No mention of the crease and how deep it will be"
The Z Fold 5 will be a far better option by leaps and bounds! The pixel fold is disappointing.
"That’s….a lot. First Gen products will always be expensive, but sheesh it’s a lot"
"Btw, what’s the thickness in mm when opened for the pixel fold?"
Google will simultaneously make the best value phone and the worst all at once.
"I don’t think it’s worth 2x their pixel pro. The $1799 should be the most expensive it gets, and be 1tb."
"Without an s-pen or thin type stylus, this is pointless for the price. Especially since competitors are releasing foldable phones at a cheaper price. Also it could at least be 512 for 1799. And finally instead of a free watch, just take away 149 dollars off."
I would consider buying this and I use an iPhone. Let’s see if it’s how we’re thinking
Sam says he calls your cheeks “pixel fold”. They open and clap shut.
Madness with that price
"Hard pass.  I will wait for the bugs to be worked out and see if GrapheneOS is available for it first.  Who actually wants a Pixel watch? (even if it is ""free"")"
Jern did it again!!!
I'm ready for it.
"I won’t leave Apple. Even though im really beginning to want these fold phones. Samsung has had a more diverse range of products for a long while… and Apple sticks with the same it’s had since the iPhone 1. Lol they have made screens longer but the width remains about the same. I would like a wider phone designed for writers and note taking and that kind of thing… I am almost certain that Apple will follow the pack before long and implement their own fold eventually, but then again… we’ve seen a diverse range of devices over the last 5 years and Apple sticks with the same design."
Im good with my regular pixel pro. i dont even know what i would use that for.  cant even fit that in my pocket
"I still don’t understand the folding phone hype. Why would I want to carry something that big and bulky around all the time as my main device? I can see a potential benefit of having the technology available for future uses, but I have zero desire to buy a folding phone…. Much less to pay that much money for it when I could spend that money on a great computer or laptop that would run circles around it."
"These fold phones are more gimmicks than anything revolutionary. Look at Samsung, the fold specs were sub-par"
For that price they should give you the watch and pixel buds
"This has the potential to be really cool, and I'm glad it's being made, but I am really struggling to see what the point of it is.. There is no way I would carry that thing in my pocket, if I was at home I would use a laptop instead and on the train I would use an iPad.  It would also be a huge thief magnet in London."
Any regular Pixel around the corner??
"Given how accurate these leaks usually are, what even is the point of watching the launch events? This is kind of why apply always has higher view count on their announcements."
"A first gen product from a company that doesn't particularly have a good track record with first gen products, for $1,800? That'll be a no"
I would wait two weeks for a price drop.
"And why does Jon prosser look so chill and charming in this video  no craziness no nothing.

Btw, the pixel fold is going to pretty much destroy everything as we know it this year. The hype is gonna be through the roofs"
Anything about the Pixel Watch 2?
"If it was an iPhone I'd pay the $1799. Because the phone would be well supported for probably close to a decade. Google will give up after 2 years, if that."
Does it have wireless charging?
"The short answer is not worth it one bit. The pixel 7 Pro was cheaper than other flagship Devices because It didn't compete on the same level In power and google wouldn't be able to justify a 1100$ for midrange chipset capability, but they are competing at similar price with a prototype first gen looking foldable with an already outdated bezel to display look, pixel fold is gonna flop soo hard with that price, I really love the pixel 7 pro and it's a big success for Google but the fold is gonna set them back again and I'm afraid that would make them hesitant to pursue a second gen foldable"
"Get your hands ready for a face palm because from the specs, it doesn't with that much."
I'll stick to my Pro 7 until the Fold 2
The Google Pixel Fold was cheaper last year the rumor went around. Sad Now.
"If Google comes with no crease, affordable price, biggest battery and wider display.i am on it.otherwise I would never upgrade until I really see major improvement and innovation.peace and be smart."
I’ll wait for Apple to reveal their foldable... watch.
i still have a question  what about crease?
"Good video as usual, but no one is commenting best hair in the youtube tech game!"
Might be time to make the jump back to android
Let's wait for preorders :)
"Google nailed with the form factor. Kinda like a throwback to those old 16:9 ratios, which comes in very handy in ""smartphone mode"". With Google doing the software work Im quite confident the Pixel Fold will take the foldable experience to another level.(at least for their formfactor). Bezels are a bit big on the interior screen but otherwise I love it. Also looking forward to Android 14 as it will bring major improvements for all foldable users(to some extent)."
"I like my Z flip 3, but miss some of the Pixel features. I don't know if I'll go for the fold out tablet style though. Wish they were releasing a flip style"
I want it so bad
This is just mind-blowing
Guessing they saved the thinner bezels for Pixel Fold 2.
"It’s been a while since I’ve watched Unbox Therapy, but I’m glad to see you’re videos are still high quality and informative"
"This looks incredible. A considered approach and a great 1st shot at a foldable. Unfortunately I’m insanely deep in the Apple ecosystem, so hopefully they build one soon! I really want this!"
"Reminds me on the Surface Duo, but without the bezels"
Absolutely love the design and aspect ratio.
You have the best ideas.
I think the aspect ratio here makes more sense than the z fold's
️*️*️*️*️
"The pricetag is a big disappointment. Only 3 countries get the pixel watch bundled with the phone in this price tag. Other countries where their currency is already weak due to rising $, other brands won't be worried as their prices are lower. Hopefully Google can slash their prices quickly in coming months."
It would be great with 8 Gen 2 instead of rebranded Exynos called Tensor
I wish my folding wallet is that thikkk
Been waiting 2yrs for this just pre-ordered on Google...Also already ordered my latercase in CRIMSON but can we do a LIME GREEN or CANDY GREEN colorway PLEASE!!!
"Looks good,but the bezels kill it for me,like the Z Folds the next generation will improve that?I'll stick to Z Folds for now"
"Been waiting for this, Thankyou Sir"
Them bezels tho
Google needs to really learn how to create a very reliable and clean phone before they go into making a folding phone. Their normal phones have enough issues already.
"I do think that the form factor is much better than the competition, but I don't think they're going to disrupt the market as much due to the crease sticking out in the unfolded mode. Apparently Samsung have fixed the crease in the up and coming galaxy fold 5 but we'll see!"
"You seem to be excited for basically the same features found on folding devices prior. While the form factor ratio is much usable IMO when closed, a lot of features have been done before. We should just be excited that the folding market in the US has competition."
"My 2023 Smartphone Wishlist
1. Google Pixel Fold
2. Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"
Amazing
Never buy the Version 1 of any Product. Always wait for Version 2 and beyond.
"Aspect ratio like the Surface Duo is nice, that price though is way out there, should be under $1,500."
Loving the new set
7:37 that zoom.
That's nice
"Lew hasn't been feeling like himself lately, hard times.."
"Damn, this is priced higher than an RTX4090?! …"
This phone will be a huge hit on YouTube . In real life no one is spending $1800 on a first gen google product that looks like a Chinese knock off of the fold
Iphone clears Google pixel lol meow
I love the background music ...really a nice phone
"I can't wait till the actual full review. I want to see if this phone interacts well with other Google products such as the new tablet and the current pixel phone. Also, I need to see if there are extra features on this device that are not on my pixel 7 pro. I don't want it to be just a pixel 7 pro with the ability to fold and unfold that would be a little redundant."
It’s cool but I don’t think it’s better than my z fold 4
"Ah hell nah, they gotta be kidding"
"Maybe next time you should put it next to a Samsung Fold, or an iPhone... just so we can get a sense of the size of the outside screen... As we all know the inside screen is big."
"At this point, can I just have a phone with two screens? Microsoft had the Duo, but it was Microsoft and the specs were already behind when they made it."
Where's MY LEw Later??
Looks dope!
What is compatible pen on this device?
Amazing
️️
Wow what a beautiful clean device I
Loved it
Im more a samsung guy but this is nice. Price wise i have no need to upgrade from my s21+.
I pre-order mine today. I am kinda surprised how much you can see the crease when it is open.
"While the phone looks very nice, I'm surprised about 2 things: 1- nobody mentioned that crease down the middle that everyone freaks about on the Samsung Fold.  2 - Pen Support????  One of the main items I use on my Fold 4.  And actually #3, outside of the aspect ratio on the Pixel, there was not one other item in this review that I can't do with my Fold 4, for exactly the same price, so there really isn't anything new here, I'll stick with my Fold."
Laughs in Oppo Find N2 Fold!
Great content brother
The way you always know when someone needs something is amazing.
"Love the video, but the title says unboxing... where the box at?"
That’s a big No! No!
That bezel is unacceptable when literally every other company offers much better design in that department
Did I miss something. I didn’t see an actual unboxing
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content !!
How can i win that phone from unbox therapy beautiful phone
Which makes me want to trade in my Zed 3 and Zed 4 for a Google pixel fold.
"Definitely got paid by Google for this video. All the features he was stating is on all foldable phones. It's as if he was looking at notes to say, as struggled to talk fluently. Seen so many videos from him, but was definitely weird. That amount of money for a big bezzle (almost like Samsung fold 1 from 4 years ago!) average chip at best and the value being the same price as Samsung fold 4."
"Honestly, I don't understand the hype. The bezels on the inside look bad compared to all other foldables out there. The front screen width is nice, but I feel like the reasoning for a narrow front screen on others is due to the thickness of it and how easy it is to use with one hand without reaching too hard."
Just watched the whole video! Super excited for it!
That bezel is thicker than my baby mama
"Unless they come out with a smaller version at a more affordable cost, it doesn't beat the galaxy flip for me. But I would grab in an instant if I had money on hand best overall in terms of flip phones, in my opinion."
First comment
"He quickly moves onto a different subject when he was talking about the internal display, but the fact is, its as fragile as the samsung fold phones, you can still damage it with your fingernails.

This guy is obviously more into views and money rather than a genuine no frills umboxing and review, no criticism either, only good things."
In need a phone am low on budget man  mine is dying
"по рамкам и дизайну вцелом это конечно не конкурент китайцам и корейцам, но поколения через 2-3 научатся делать как остальные"
Thats wild preparing for a video myself can’t wait to get my hands on to review
I have to 7 pro but that's cool as hell
Topz
"I SEEM to NOTICE a CHANGE,  be real ""Unbox Therapy"", don't change the style to make video. You are still the King of Tech Youtube section.  I like your videos!"
"The crease in the screen looks very prominent on the video, does it feel that way in person? Finally a folding phone I want to pick up."
Uh
"I want to see how the Pixel Fold will do against the Z Fold 5, Oppo N3, Vivo X Fold 2/2 Plus, Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold 3 and Honor Magic V2 later at a very expensive price for the specs it carries"
shoulkd i still keep my fold 3 if i dont need to upgrade
"This Pixel Fold might be very solid for a Gen 1 product which is surprising because Apple, Google, and Samsung are not the greatest with Gen 1 products."
Just preordered ! Had to get the $399 pixel watch since they wouldnt give me another $50 if i got the cheaper one
First being heree!!!
You do know this split view works on the Fold 4 right?
why does it look like a Surface phone from Microsoft?
"What is the circle with the - symbol between the battery and voicemail notification on the AOD?
Also, can you not get below 60hrtz if you don’t turn on “smooth display”? It doesn’t make sense that you can’t get full use of the panned being able to save you some battery"
This is a surface duo with an external display and a full internal screen.
Love the vids
Great for old Galaxy fold users. They are giving $750 for Fold2 $800 for Fold3 along with Pixel watch(wifi or lte).
"I'm gonna wait for the Pixel Fold A model. Google's budget phones are satisfactory, maybe more, for the price"
The outer screen is going to get trashed using it as a tripod. It's on the bottom when you use it that way.
Why does the wall look like a diamond block in minecraft? Keep up the work lew!
"Holy shit that’s wide as f*ck. Why Google Why?
Waiting for Lew to post a complete review later."
