The fact they are using a Snapdragon chip for all worldwide phones is definitely a good change. European users were getting short changed
"I think they should have a 2 year launch cycle for phones, itll allow them to further optimize last gen phones softwares even more and improve their overall brand image."
"Currently using the 22 Ultra which I'm really happy with, will probably upgrade when the 24 or 25 Ultra gets released, will be a slightly bigger step up then"
"As a camera person, it's amazing how this phone is able to get that type of quality off of that small of a sensor with that small of a lens, the AI is just crazy tbh. Also low light too, it seems to do better than an APS-C cmos sensor, which is way bigger than a phone sensor."
"I have used my S22 Ultra for a few months now, and I can't complain about anything. I moved from an S10+ so the jump was miles big and it really felt like it deserved the money even though I paid like 900$ for the phone. Seeing the S23 Ultra, I have to say that, even though I love the design of the S22, keeping it the exact same is not one of the best moves that Samsung made. Also, I bought the S22 mostly for the camera, which didn't disappoint at all. Seeing the new camera, I can say that it is definitely an upgrade, but I cannot say that it is worth to go from an S22 Ultra to an S23 Ultra. If you really need a better camera, for almost 1300$ it would be better to buy a DSLR and get better photos and videos, as the S22 Ultra has a more than good camera for day to day photos. I can see myself buying a new phone when the S24 Ultra appears maybe. Then the jump would be higher and the difference would definitely be worth it. I just hope that Samsung doesn't randomly decide to reduce the quality of the cameras with dumb software updates"
"Got mine in yesterday. It's a massive difference for me coming from an S10+. Happy about the new GB upgrade. Love how responsive it is and the speakers. When I need a new phone, it will probably be in 5+ years. So far a good investment."
"I actually kind of like that Samsung hasn't changed their design. Like you said, the similarly to the previous model means that the internal improvements will take the spotlight and be more noticeable. It also prevents people from impulse buying a new phone just because it looks different, because I know there are people out there that do."
"As someone who's not the biggest tech nerd, your videos always still seem to entertain me somehow. Love how you work to appeal to such a wide audience, regardless of who is watching the video!"
"I made the switch from an S21 Ultra to the S23 Ultra, and WOW. I'm mindblown by the huge change and also features that that S-Pen has. This phone is a huge game changer. Too bad my mother doesn't see phones the way we do, but atleast she's happy that I got her the iPhone 14 Pro Max ️"
"I got mine yesterday. Coming from a Note 10+ and the difference is really noticeable. The screen is far more vivid, thanks to the new and faster memory chips applications get installed much faster, the camera got better as well, especially in low light environments. For users with S22 Ultra this is probably not that huge upgrade, but for me it was. The Snapdragon is definitely one of the best features of this phone."
"Ok one thing I want to point out here is that the phone lowering the highlight and increasing the shadows is really good for real estate photography. Usually, I would take three photos with a normal camera, one under exposed, one just right, and one over exposed. Then, in post I would combine those three photos together in order to get an even lighting. This would mean I have 3x less storage in my CFX type b card, and since I can't do this when I'm filming a video, it's a really nice feature that more phones should have. Also the stabilization is also an added bonus since normally I would need to buy a $500 dollar stabilizer just for it. So overall I'm impressed. Also that 8k is nice too."
"Just preordered mine, going to be a massive upgrade from the S9+ Ive been using for the last 5 years"
"These videos are absolutely incredible! Delightful, engaging and enjoyable! This is definitely my favourite YouTube channel. Also, the quality of these videos is amazing! Can’t imagine the amount of time and effort that goes into each of these videos! Great work!"
"I just upgraded from my note 10 plus, as trade in values are too good to ignore. It's clear that it was the blue print for these phones . I feel like all I really did was get a noticeably better camera ..... and as you mentioned a sharpened design.. I felt for the 300 dollar price gap it was about time for a new device."
"Compared with my note 20 ultra s23 ultra has a smaller screen and is both heavier, thicker and wider. I think the biggest issue with the ultras is the size that has grown over what is comfortable to use and carry. I want to see a ultra spec at around 200gr max. I won't upgrade this time either cause at 208gr note 20 ultra is already on the limit. 234 gram and with a smaller screen doesn't really appeal."
"I checked it out in a store and I like S23 Ultra more than S22 because of less curved screen, improved speakers and better vibrations.
Not sure if this along with better camera is worth the difference in price though."
"I know with 100 percent certainty that you did not intend this, but this is like 13 minutes of a Samsung marketing dream. I do not think anyone at Samsung could have done a better job marketing the S23 Ultra than you did in this video. In fact, I actually have become very excited to watch full reviews of the S23 Ultra, and I think I'm a bit jealous as an iPhone user, even with a 14 Pro Max. Thank you for a great video Arun and team (including Milo :)"
"I've ordered this as my upgrade from the inconsistent S20 Ultra. The software upgrades eventually made the phone a solid choice, but overall it didn't have the wow factor. 

I'm hoping this iteration is a marked inprovement."
"Still using my s22 ultra and loving it ,not gonna get the 23 but perhaps maybe the 24 if I can get a good deal like I did with my 22, I like that Samsung kept the design , very proud that Samsung can go toe to toe and in some cases beat Apple."
"The pen is a must have for me.
I don't use it often but when I do use it, it's very handy. I was disappointed when it wasn't available on certain models."

S23 Ultra looks amazing but I'm happy with my S22 ultra. Looking forward to upgrade when the new fold comes out
"I legit make sure it's your channel before I see any reviews on any phone. That's how phenomenal you are. You out so much into your videos and you genuinely care. 

I am contemplating whether I should go from s21 ultra to s23 ultra."
All phone companies are changing/upgrading their products less and less for each launch. But is a new model in any predominant brand even necessary? If they focused more on upgrading the software every year and only launching a phone when they reach a groundbreaking level of change and upgrades it would be really nice as well. Should make a video addressing this since you seem to have great impacts on the tech world. Love your videos btw great quality and thought put into each one!!!
"Your unboxing is longer, more informative and more in depth then most people's reviews, hats off"
"I'm going to get that phone just for the 8k. Although it maybe not be 100% 8k, it's still best price for an 8k anything. Usually I have to spend so much in order to get even a decent 6k camera which usually costs 4-5k dollars, which can at best do 4k 30fps. For example, Sony, used a 12 megapixel sensor for their 6,000 dollar camera Sony a7s iii, just so that it would have a better low light performance, because higher megapixel = more grain. And the fact that this small camera is able pull off such quality without any grain is just so mind boggling to me. AI too, normally Canon cameras are known for their dual pixel ai auto focus, which is the best one the market right now. And to hear that this camera has it is really crazy."
"Loved this review. Wondering whether I should upgrade from my Nord. My device is fast and has an amoled screen.
Samsung didn't go for a 4k screen, which kinda makes it a relatively expensive upgrade."
"I'll be sticking to my S21 ultra for a few more years hopefully. But, it's great to know that there is going to be an incredible upgrade to a still impressive phone down the road."
Thank for the video Arun. I have 22 ultra and while I do love some of these new features the main one being no exynos chips anymore. I don't think it's enough change fore to upgrade at that price I have the 512gb version aswell. So 1400 for a phone is a bit too much in this current day. And samsungs trade in deal aren't as good this time they will only drop £499 off
"This was the best review on the S23 ultra I heard so far. He goes into detail on all the improvements. I would like him to do a speaker test. Samsung has been poor sound. Quilty it does not affect me as I use Bluetooth speaker, but it would be nice not to have to."
The camera comparisons this year are gonna be wild
"I remember when I first got the galaxy s8 it was my first experience with night shot photos and I was blown away that it could see perfectly in total darkness where I couldn't see a thing, with no flash. Now it's pretty common on phones. I miss the night vision of the s20 ultra and note 10 plus though."
"Bro u were so enthusiastic about this phone. I preordered it and after watching it I’m ready to get my hands on it right now! U literally sold this phone! And thanks for explaining the pixels. Some may not understand how complex and important it is with camera quality upgrades, but u did a great job explaining it."
What I'm hoping for personally is basically a fold with the specs of the ultra that would be the perfect phone for me
"I jumped from a samsung Galaxy A71 to the S23 Ultra.. I haven't had a flagship phone since the S4.. so this is amazing for me.. the screen is insanely better than my last phone, and better than my SOs iPhone 13 pro max.. the sound coming from the phone itself truly surprised me.. the capabilities of the S pen has been fun too.. all around very happy with my decision to buy this"
"The production quality of Arun's videos are incredible. His consistency, quality, and production make him one of the greatest tech youtubers on the platform. Great job Arun!"
"I'm in two minds about upgrading, I currently have the Oppo find x2 Pro and happy with it for the most part. I'm not sure if I should wait till next year and see what comes out then my concerns with upgrading are:
-Battery charging times / how long it holds the charge
-Would like to no more about Dex"
"1:06 I always thought that anything higher than 12MP is going to be a bad camera, more pixels to process and less light to each one, it seems that 12 is kind of a sweet spot
Basically they should call it S22.5 Super Ultra"
"Loving my new S23 Ultra in every single way. I prayed for improved video quality over my Exynos S21 Ultra which was crippled by it's low bitrate and excess noise and mushy detail dropout, and my prayers were more than answered. Low light and indoor video is now stunning with massively reduced noise and massively increased detail all thanks in no small part to a much increased bitrate. Even at 4K60. Outdoor video now oozes detail and sharpness without oversaturating especially at (now gloriously usable) 8K, and the stabilization is incredible. Thanks for making my dreams come true for once Samsung. It shouldn't have taken so long for your video to be in the IPhone's league though."
"Writing from an S23 Ultra i can confirm, yes its incredible. I hated my S22U, used for a year and it had UI stutter and performance issues. Gaming was not possible du to the heat and the batterylife was trash. This device, even its just the next gen one, gave me the WOW effect. The speed is insane and gaming is now possible. Btw the SD8 gen 2 on the Samsung phones are overclocked ones"
The amount of time and accuracy Arun puts into researching each video you know he's not baiting or stretching the truth. It's exactly as he says. Bravo
"Switched over for a week now on my S23 Ultra and it has been flawless, a real home run for Samsung. The processing speed and outright battery life are highlights, since I don't use the camera as often. I've started to use S pen for my day to day work and it has been a huge benefit instead of using paper and notes as I've done before. Yes the S23 Ultra is pricey but damn is it a quality product."
I've waited since Note 9. I've bought it 3 days ago. It's freaking amazing.
as usual you guys make the best reviews. the S23 ultra seems impressive.
using snapdragon on s23 ultra for the ENTIRE world might be one of the best decisions samsung has ever made
I feel bad for people that don't use the s pen or understand how amazing it is to be able to perform the actions it does on a phone. Simply amazing and life altering. I'll never leave the s pen after having 1.
The first 18 seconds were spectacular. It's like I'm watching a movie trailer! The review I'm looking forward to as always!
"I will be honest, I was not going to upgrade to the s23 ultra from the s22 ultra but to be honest its been worth it so far. I really like it although design didn't change but battery life is significantly better and performance i can see is more snappier. Cameras of course are always the best from Samsung. Cheers!"
"I have waited for this review. Thank you so much, Wills. Your reviews are superb."
The note was my favorite phone ever. When I upgraded away from the Note 9 I always felt I was missing something. I can't wait for my S23 ultra to come in.
"I'm a Fold convert, but I was setting up my wife's S23U, and...WOW. The thing is seriously fast, and the battery life is phenom."
Awesome review as always. The Intro and B roll footages are top tier .
"The picture quality is definitely a step up from the fold 3 but not sure if it's hardware limitation or software that requires optimizing,  but shutter lag is definitely worst than the fold3 and autofocus is slower with the laser photo focus than the dual pixel af on the fold 3 and can be buggy when camera app first launch up,  it can be out of focus and refuse to change focus automatically and use have to press on screen to engage af, causing further delays"
Absolutely a beast phone if you already have a s22 ultra don't upgrade but if you're about to buy a new Samsung go for this one it's worth the money
"I have been wanting to upgrade my Ultra 20 Note to 23 only for the camera. However, the photo comparison you displayed convinced me not to, since I found the portriat in the coffee shop not as detailed as the 22 and the lighting as good. Of course, I am on a world tour for the past 10 months and I have been very pleased with my pictures but am not too happy about the sharpness. Also, I am not happy that I won't be able to replace the Sim card since in some countries you must. Well, I can wait another year."
"So tempted but I'm just worried I'm too used to smaller smsrtphones- I loved my Blackberry Passport, the last truly large phone I had. Maybe I will give this a go!"
"Great review as always, keep up the good work!"
"I ordered this phone from Samsung UK website for £831. Hope it delivers what it promise, because I went this time for the specs and long battery life. My Galaxy S20 FE 5G was good, but it was noticeably degrading in terms of battery and couldn't handle well multi-tasking with certain apps I use."
I hope one day Samsung will have Quad speakers and on their Ultra phones too
"Going to give this phone a try. Good review. Please consider also including some action shots (sports, pets, etc.) in your camera evaluation."
I have a perfectly functional S20 Ultra and it would probably make it another year but upgraded to the S23 Ultra in green.

Brilliant review as always . I’m looking to upgrade to the S23 from an iPhone 11. Just trying to work out if the extra price for the ultra worth it over the s23 plus though…?
"You guys have the best intros into the video you can ever find on YouTube, arguably better than the ones on the manufacturers' channels"
I always admire and watch reviews of phones that I can't afford to buy . Wish I can own even S10 plus
Thank You gsmarena to not overhype this phone like others and putting forth the points in a regular manner.. Also a big thanks for pointing out that S23 Ultra Display lacks 10 Bit Color Profile and is still stuck with the archaic 16.7 Million 8 Bit boring colors to play with!!.. Even phones that cost 1/5th of S23 Ultra offer awesome features like 10 Bit Color palette & Dolby Vision Support!!.. A big  for Samsung display esp considering the attrocious pricing!
Ihave the S23 Ultra since the 4 of February and so far the experience has been top notch no app crash no slow downs when browsing the webb great camera performance and amzing batterylife and best of all the sd 8gen 2 makes a hug improvement and does it jobb .
S23Ultra is truly a refinements of previous S22Ultra with an additional features and upgrades.
Apple people don't like hearing that their are better phones than the 14 pm . AS a owner of the 14 pm since I've been using the s23 ultra the 14 pm sits collecting dust . Both phones are excellent I prefer the feel of the s23 ultra
hope samsung will put the snapdragon Gen 2 for galaxy processor into Tab S9. imagine the battery life on a tablet
This s23 ultra is soooo perfect that it's hard for haters to find real flaws
I was gonna go Pixel 7 Pro but after I heard the problems with the lens I think I  should go with Samsung again.
I have this beast and love her (Green/256gb/8gb ram). Previously I had the S21 Ultra 256GB.
You are one of my favourite international smartphone reviewer. This phone seems the best phone of this moment. Only it's very expensive. I have now the S21 Ultra and I can choose from October on a new phone. Hopefully the price will be more low at that time. I'm thinking maybe I will choose a Google Pixel 8 pro or maybe the Motorola Edge 40 ultra. These seems also very good but for a much lower price!
So they got rid of the 100x zoom?? That helps with seeing things from far away haha also was useful at my job seeing stuff from the 3rd tier racks without bringing it down
"What's samsung record with software updates? I know it varies a lot by region or carrier, but most they get consistent updates in timely fashion? Ideally no later than a month?"
I've got an S22 Ultra and there's really nothing wrong with it. Looking up reviews for the S23 Ultra was a mistake because now I've caused myself FOMO.
I've been waiting for your full review
"Going slightly offtopic, what would some of you say is currently the cheapest phone with  an exceptionally bright panel, 700 nits or beyond?"
Thanks Will. Best phone reviewer by a mile
"What I like about it:

Camera(s). 
Display."
Is it ok to use 30 watts fast charging to s23 ultra?
"I've had my Note 10 for well over 3 years now and I'm still amazed what a bargain it was. Great futuristic design, base model with 256gb. Still going strong with no issues what so ever. And thank you for making videos like this Lisa. We all do appreciate it :)"
The review that we all are waiting for. Thanks for your no BS thoughts as always LIsa!
This channel IMHO is the gold standard of cell phone reviews
"The upgrade of the S23 series is like when Samsung went from the Note 8 to the 9, they fixed everything wrong with the first one while keeping all the great things about it. These are low key, the best years for upgrades if you want your phone to last 4+ years easily."
"MobileTechReview and Lisa do some great reviews.
The S23 (Ultra) looks huge, more so than the iPhone 13PM/14PM.
Longer battery life is appreciated. For most users who don't do gaming or aren't photographers or videographers, the performance sounds very good as well as the long battery life."
"Those cases look pretty good. I'm going to check them out. I have Samsung's silicone case and while I like it, I do feel like I want to prop the phone up from time to time."
"Coming from my S21 Ultra (Exynos version), the S23 Ultra is evidently snappier, camera is a lot better and battery so far is much better too.
Fingers crossed all these good things continue since I will surely be keeping this phone for 2 years at least."
"Okay, the basic reality is if you have an S21 or S22, you really don't need to upgrade, it's a want not a need.
But for folks like me that last upgraded before the Plandemic the S23 ultra is a serious upgrade, and with the discounts and Trade in credits it's an easy choice to make."
"Always a treat to see your smartphone reviews, Lisa! Cheers from Buenos Aires."
You are really Adding value to those who are about to make a purchase decision.
"My S23 Ultra arrived Tuesday, and I'm loving it! Trading my S22 Ultra and got a great deal, as always. I trade my ""Note"" phone every year and have had them all. I'm an avid s-pen user."
thx Lisa for turning me onto your ESR sponsor products. I got some for my new iphone 14 pro and am very happy with it.
One of the best and original tech reviewers.
You're one of my favorite reviewers! :)
"I came from the s22 ultra and the 23 is a BIG upgrade in many ways, zero argument about it"
I just got an s22 ultra and I'm not sure if i regret that decision hearing how good the battery life is on the s23 ultra
"I find that they toned down the saturation on the photo processing this time around, which is appreciated"
"thanks for your reviews, still great coverage~"
"Lisa is a blast, fantastic technical reviews, and sums it all up with ""its the bee'es knees"" Brilliant."
Come on folks. Let’s get this channel to 1M subscribers this year.
"I've had my Note 10 for well over 3 years now and I'm still amazed what a bargain it was. Great futuristic design, base model with 256gb. Still going strong with no issues what so ever. And thank you for making videos like this Lisa. We all do appreciate it :)"
The review that we all are waiting for. Thanks for your no BS thoughts as always LIsa!
This channel IMHO is the gold standard of cell phone reviews
"The upgrade of the S23 series is like when Samsung went from the Note 8 to the 9, they fixed everything wrong with the first one while keeping all the great things about it. These are low key, the best years for upgrades if you want your phone to last 4+ years easily."
"MobileTechReview and Lisa do some great reviews.
The S23 (Ultra) looks huge, more so than the iPhone 13PM/14PM.
Longer battery life is appreciated. For most users who don't do gaming or aren't photographers or videographers, the performance sounds very good as well as the long battery life."
"Those cases look pretty good. I'm going to check them out. I have Samsung's silicone case and while I like it, I do feel like I want to prop the phone up from time to time."
"Coming from my S21 Ultra (Exynos version), the S23 Ultra is evidently snappier, camera is a lot better and battery so far is much better too.
Fingers crossed all these good things continue since I will surely be keeping this phone for 2 years at least."
"Okay, the basic reality is if you have an S21 or S22, you really don't need to upgrade, it's a want not a need.
But for folks like me that last upgraded before the Plandemic the S23 ultra is a serious upgrade, and with the discounts and Trade in credits it's an easy choice to make."
"Always a treat to see your smartphone reviews, Lisa! Cheers from Buenos Aires."
You are really Adding value to those who are about to make a purchase decision.
"My S23 Ultra arrived Tuesday, and I'm loving it! Trading my S22 Ultra and got a great deal, as always. I trade my ""Note"" phone every year and have had them all. I'm an avid s-pen user."
thx Lisa for turning me onto your ESR sponsor products. I got some for my new iphone 14 pro and am very happy with it.
One of the best and original tech reviewers.
You're one of my favorite reviewers! :)
"I came from the s22 ultra and the 23 is a BIG upgrade in many ways, zero argument about it"
I just got an s22 ultra and I'm not sure if i regret that decision hearing how good the battery life is on the s23 ultra
"I find that they toned down the saturation on the photo processing this time around, which is appreciated"
"thanks for your reviews, still great coverage~"
"Lisa is a blast, fantastic technical reviews, and sums it all up with ""its the bee'es knees"" Brilliant."
Come on folks. Let’s get this channel to 1M subscribers this year.
"""The Bee's Knees!"" So lovely to know there are still a few folks out there breathing life into that delightful idiom!"
We need to get an overview and review of all the quirky shirts she has in her possession.
Will personalized colors option be available in the next update?
Could you review the regular S23 and S23 plus?
Thanks for the review I am upgrading from the S10 so looking forward the its arrival.
"Get a screen protector too. Mine has very tiny scratches or abrasions on the screen after a  day. All other phones I use or test don't have these. If you want better battery, it's worth the upgrade alone."
Excellent review..concise and effective..
I've just bitt the bullet n finally upgraded from note 10 plus to 1tb model of this phone. Battery life on is phone is amazing n I went with esa clear kick stand case
Best review so far. No bias. Very objective.
"i have an s22 that ima keep til it gives out wether it breaks or takes a dump, hopefully it lasts a while, my last samsung had a bad charger in like 18 months which sucked"
"Wow. Note 20 ultra really was the peak I guess. Got the high refresh rate, big battery, s pen, and microSD card slot. I still miss the headphone jack, but I did cave and get some buds2 pros"
I think I'm NOT going to get the S23U. I prefer smaller phones. I had the LG V20 for 2 years and hated putting it in my pocket and impossible to use it in a holster case in vertical or horizontal position since it's too tall and wide. I like the convenience and ergonomics of smaller phones.
Wait for Galaxy Notes (S Ultras) to get a totally flat screen. Also a side button fingerprint. Underscreen fingerprint RUINS pen input. Wonder why Lisa never mentioned it.
"Luckily I'm not one of the odd bunch that are crying about saying it's not enough of an upgrade from the S22U...

It's a fantastic upgrade from my S10+"
There's no place like MobileTechReview
Always a delightful experience to see your channel videos respected ma'am!
This channel is the bee's knees of tech reviews. Love it!
"Coming from the note 9, I am glad I waited this long to upgrade"
"Perfect phone, perfect review (as always)."
I'm still running my trusty Note 20 Ultra and kinda wanted to upgrade to this but honestly I can't justify it.  My Note 20 is still plenty fast plus it's paid for.  I just can't seem to find anything with the 23 that makes me want to cough up $50/month for.
Went from a Note 9 to the S23 Ultra. What a jump! Love it!
"The s23 line up is very compelling this year, with all the camera, processors and battery improvements for sure."
"Samsung has reported that the 23 Ultras pre-order surpassed the past two Ultras, in sales. So even though reviewers initially panned this device as a minor upgrade, consumers were far more intrigued."
"Last year I upgraded from Note 8 to s22 Ultra I was underwhelmed if im honest. As I'm on upgrade programme I decided to just go for s23 Ultra which is 100% worth it in comparison to the s22 Ultra. Very happy with the performance, battery life and aesthetics"
"I bought the S23 Ultra, and have had it for about 5 days already.  I can tell you that the performance is blazing fast, and that's my perspective even though I had the S22 Ultra before.  Battery life looks promising, as do the cameras, but it's still too soon to give a final verdict.  IMHO it's the best phone available for purchase at this point."
"The response of the tech community in North America was a little bit underwhelming. Cause here in Europe, even though there wasn’t a revolutionary change in term of design, the fact that finally everyone has gotten the Qualcomm version has changed a lot for others that got the Exynos versions in the past."
"Got myself the Ultra
It's my first non-iPhone since like forever
And I love it
Samsung finally ironed out what I hat doubts about and with their amazing software (features) it's just the right device for me"
"I usually get the latest smartphone every year.  I'm having difficulty with that this year.  I have the S22 Ultra. Went into my carrier on the 17th to compare the S23 Ultra side by side and get the in hand feel.  I just couldn't find reasons to purchase it when it appears to be so similar to my S22 Ultra or such a minor upgrade. I asked the sales associate if it's worth it to upgrade from my S22 Ultra to the S23 Ultra, and he said that it wasn't.  The fact that he was honest rather than wanting to make a sale really struck me and helped with the decision so far.  He said that I'd basically be buying the same phone.  Appreciated his honesty.  Now I'm just left with the struggle of having to have the newest and latest."
"I switched from Note 20 Ultra. The change is great, I regret nothing"
"Night Mode is supported with 10x and 3x. Of course, it will use 3x instead of 10x if it is very dark and 1x instead of 3x if it is very very dark."
"The battery on my S20+ was getting bad, so I was forced to downgrade to the S23 Ultra. The new phone happened to be free, so I got the phone with the biggest battery.

Oddly enough, the thing I miss most about my old phone is not the microSD slot, but the bit of circuitry that allowed the S20 to trick magnetic-strip credit card reader. Because I'm in the technically-backwards country of the USA, a lot of trailers don't have tap functionality in their credit card readers. As of now, the number of trailers at which I can pay with my phone dropped by a lot."
I wish the S23 Ultra looked more like the non Ultra S23 models. They look far more comfortable to hold with rounded edges
Jumped from S20+ to S23 ultra. This phone ticks all the right boxes and special applause to Samsung for improving battery life
"My S22 Ultra gives me about 5-6 Hours screen on time...I get about 20-30 minutes extra if I do FHD+ 60hz.

I recently switched back to my LG V60 which consistently gives me 9-10 hours screen on time. I switched back cause I miss its more natural camera and no lag, louder speaker and I got a 1TB Micro SD in it."
"Not sure why you mention less than 1 hour 0 to 100% charging. I have Samsung's official 45W charger and it's always more than hour in my tests (like 1 hour and 6 minutes). While the difference is negligible, it is consistent — it's always hour and 6 minutes. So I wonder how is it even possible to get a result of less than an hour when the chip and the battery are exactly the same around the world in S23 Ultra."
Best lookin phone ever made period.  love using this phone just switched from iPhone 13pro to this and man what a move I made
Samsung just needs to provide 65w or above charging speed. Other features seem to be enough for now.
"im upgrading from an A8 to S23U, so its a big deal for me"
Wish they offered some great color pallet to choose from

S22ultra still a Beast
S23 Ultra: Own it. Love it. Can't wait for some updates. Wish it didn't have Samsung bloatware. Awesome phone.
Honestly I was holding onto my note 20 ultra. However a deal from the company got me to upgrade. This is what the note 20 ultra should have been. No performance issues what so ever.
I'm good with my s22 ultra for a few more years.
"I have an S22 Ultra with 512Gb I bought for the reason of keeping it a few years for once. I'm not upgrading for the S23, hah."
You have a very good narrative voice and you sound very clear. Thank you for sharing this wonderful S23 Ultra review..
"S20 ultra still going strong, mostly..... not sure I want to shell out money right now.  Camera means nothing to me."
"So, I'm a huge phone nerd.  And I mean huge.  I pay attention to, and am aware of most modern phones in detail.  I've watched practically every video about the 23U available in English on YouTube.  I'm interested in what the reviewers had to say."
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra it's kind of S22 S Ultra. A bit spectacular.
The fact that no big reviewers are reviewing the the 23+ is beyond frustrating!
"I bought it, so far the one annoying thing is you can't turn off the fake shutter sound from camera settings 
and that sound ruins pet pics if I forget to turn off sys sound. 
My friends S22 Ultra has a separate setting to turn it off."
Does it shoot 25 and 50FPS?
"Frome the s21ult to the 23ult, there's is a big jump! 
•Screen brighter ️ 
•x2 photo resolution
•12mp to 50mp raw pictures"
"Oddly, Samsung also released two other versions of the S23 but all you media lot keep spouting on about the Ultra model.  Lets have some reviews of the base & plus models too."
It is just too damn expensive unless you are a millionaire. The Plus with a 2-3 year contract on the other hand seems like a better value but it is a big shame how much better the Ultras cameras are.
I think I'm NOT going to get the S23U. I prefer smaller phones. I had the LG V20 for 2 years and hated putting it in my pocket and impossible to use it in a holster case in vertical or horizontal position since it's too tall and wide. I like the convenience and ergonomics of smaller phones.
Traded my pixel 7 pro for a Fold 4 for an S23 ultra so can't complain
Can't wait for the Xiaomi 13 Pro global version
Picking mine up today.  I’m still rocking an iPhone 8 so I’m ready for an upgrade.
Planning to buy s23 ultra 1 TB. Even 1 TB variant is  UFS 4.0 right
"I gotta say, the writing, filming and editing of these reviews is...ultra good!"
Went from an S8 I'd been using for almost 6 years to an S23 ultra and I can't believe how long the battery lasts and how good the cameras are. Wow!
I went from S22+ Ultra to S23+ Ultra and even I noticed the difference in battery and Cameras. The ability to actually have a sharp signature in PDF's is a big thing for me too.
Went from a note 8 to S23 Ultra. Huge upgrade for me. The battery life is crazy.
Love my S22 ultra. It felt a bit heavy switching over from the S10+ but  got used to it very quickly. I'll probably upgrade in 2024.
I've had this phone for two weeks now and it's a juggernaut. The performance is elite and the battery is out of this world. Samsung went deep in their bag with this S23 Ultra.
Went from Galaxy S9 to S23 ultra. This is an insane jump!
"As a iPhone user for the longest time, i watched the new S23 ultra with a open mindset. I gotta say, im impressed."
"After some pontification I bought the s23. I'm glad I did. It's unexpectedly good at macro, so I'm ditching my DSLR for when I'm in the field. No more carrying that bulk is a large improvement for me. The 3x and 10x are much better than expected. I am very happy with the telefoto macro capabilities for the object separation. (Less background that is also more blurred). Can't wait to see what photo's and videos people are going to make all over the world with these phones, also the Iphone."
Great review! The Galaxy S23 Ultra sounds like a powerhouse of a smartphone with its impressive specs and features. I'm particularly intrigued by the improved camera system and the expanded storage capacity. It's exciting to see how technology continues to advance and enhance our daily lives. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the Galaxy S23 Ultra!
I switched from S21 Ultra and I feel like a huge jump despite I really love S21 ultra and the performance was decent for me . The biggest upgrade for me is the battery life and the new camera so far.
Thank you for your videos and all the time you put into tho. Millions of people enjoy the content you put out there
S21 plus to s23 ultra here. Gotta admit the battery and efficiency are fantastic
I always love your videos because you get right to the point and explain everything without over-the-top language and gimmicks. I always check your videos before I make any major tech purchases.
"As another YouTuber that does tech reviews, I have to say that Marques is the Galaxy S23 Ultra of reviewers. He's the guy I wanna be when I grow up (let's ignore the fact that I am older than him). Cheers to another great video."
"Never watched a video before but your video title grabbed my attention over others and was a great review. I appreciate your overview at the end saying yeah it's not gonna be best in class for every feature but over all it's got everything you need, and I think that matters far more."
"currently have a iphone 13 pro max , haven’t had Samsung since the Note 8 . definitely going back to Samsung with this years Ultra since they really improved upon the camera & software ."
"I really hope the next S Ultra has all 48mp cameras and up. 10x telephoto, 2x crop, and 5x digital zoom, 100x zoom with 1/2 the amount of digital zoom. 3x telephoto, 2x crop, and 1.5x digital would mean very little detail loss across the entire camera suite."
Just upgraded from Note 10+ and this phone feels like an absolute tank on my hands.
Went from the S9 up to the 21 ultra had it for 2 years then finally went to the S23 and man my first jump was a big upgrade but even now I can honestly say the same thing the camera is amazing love the design compared to the S21 ultra super bright display good battery life

"Upgraded from the Note 9 bc battery has been dying on me way too fast nowadays, and seriously,  I'm impressed. I really didn't read anything on the S23 Ultra until today and every new thing still shocks me."
"I still have a Note 9, and it works great - no issues whatsoever. No cosmetic issues and the battery still gives me a full days worth of use. I'm tempted to upgrade but then I'm thinking if I can stretch my totally fine Note 9 another year, I could get the S24 Ultra in a year when I probably have more reason to give up my Note 9."
"Battery life in the S23U has definitely improved greatly over the S22U but I bought the ZeroLemon 10,000 mAh battery case for the Galaxy S23U. Now, the S23U battery never dies. What sucks is now my S23U has complete protection but my pockets aren't big enough for this size battery case. My pockets would need to be deep and wide as my mother's purse for it to fit into."
My S23 Ultra arrived yesterday.  The amount of detail the 200MP photos resolve blew my mind. It is so much better than my S21 Ultra and Fold 4.
"Thanks for your review. I've been coming to you for years (of course when I'm ready to upgrade a phone lol). I still have my galaxy s10+ but I'm looking to upgrade and at first I was thinking of sticking with the plus route since it hasn't failed me before (and I never felt a need for a note/ultra) but after seeing this review, this made me reconsider. Ultra it is!"
"I traded in my S22 Ultra, totally worth it. I immediately notice the incredible battery gain and it's faster. Battery is amazing"
Was going to go from Pixel 3 128GB to Pixel 7 Pro but the battery life was a turn off.  This S23 looks nice wonder if I will miss any of the google features like assistant or that slick night mode.
Interesting to see how the chip upgrade will affect the regular S23's battery life. Cant wait!!
"Would you consider doing a follow up review for shutter lag? I've found it nearly impossible to avoid motion blur on the S23 ultra, coming from the pixel series. Impossible to get a clean, sharp shot of kids and dogs. Not even the camera assistant fixes that. The computational algorithm must not be removing blur in post, which is disappointing considering the price tag."
The overall quality of this video is amazing. Kudos to the mkbhd team
Just upgraded from an s20 fe. I am in love with this phone. Thanks for mentioning the 1440p. I would have never known
"Big fan of this channel. But I have a question, I currently have the S20 Plus and looking for a change. I am not sure if i should go for the Pixel 7 Pro or the S23 Ultra. I am not looking for anything specific about the phone, just looking for a good all-rounder."
"Excellent.  Doesn't overhype paper numbers like others and adequately describes with little bias what differences are really worth noting about this phone.  Only thing he left out is a real significant bump on screen brightness (not just on paper), especially for us on pre-S22 phones.  We all aren't driving Tesla's though dude and can afford damage replacements. I think it wise to use an ultra-slim case that protects the corners and camera glass edges instead of a film.  Regarding your shirt... What about 48 fps? :)"
"In Europe we went from the Exynos 2200 or whatever model on the S22U, to the SD 8 Gen2 on the S23U. The battery is substantially better, 100% charge could last me 2 solid days of use. It's snappier, doesn't catch random slowdowns, seems happier switching between more apps and repeatedly without caring at all. Camera I haven't had much chance to really test in the past week, but what I have noticed is the refinement in image processing - detail is retained where I'd expect blurring or artifacts before."
"I was using a Google pixel 6 Pro for a year and a half, I then switched to this phone yesterday and its a beast! I have been using it as a hotspot and the battery has lasted all day"
"I went from the 21 ultra to the 23 ultra, the battery improvement is pretty huge, although I did have the Exynos S21 ultra."
I just order one. I expect to see a Big Jump on user experience/performance upgrading from S20FE to S23Ultra. Very nice review! Keep up the good job!
That 10x zoom is super useful for us who work in fielding.
Would like to know the thoughts behind S23 vs Pixel 7. As the Pixel 7 was like the best by far for 2022. Either S23+/ultra vs Pixel 7 pro. any thoughts?
"Just found your page as I'm looking to upgrade my S20 (I know, I'm very behind). I beyond appreciated the detail, flow and organization of this video. I'm also not I'm the tech world, so thanks for breaking down the tech words for us. We appreciate you!"
Thanks for watching my review! I also go into more detail on the new software features in my impressions video: https://youtu.be/iPVbDwD3u2k
Been iPhone user since the first one and I have the 14 pro I purchased the s23 ultraone week ago and WOW I'm blowned away what an amazing piece tech much props to samsung for this
"Reasons to consider buying s23 ultra
1.Better battery life 
2.Insane zoom shots and better 8k video this year
3. Faster processor. Customised 8gen2 designed for Samsung"
"I've had the 23 ultra since it was released, excellent battery life, low light photos are very good, sound from the speakers is noticeably better than the 22 ultra, I've been an S pen user for over 10 years, use it every day ,i wouldn't want to be without it, I'm an electrician, so it's brilliant for keeping notes of jobs I've been on, lighting measurements and drawings, materials lists, bits of paper get lost. As for low life shots , it has to be slower to let more light in,  and obviously you have to keep it still, same with any phone."
"Worst part of this new sensor is low light photography. Paticularly there is too much noise in the photos. I looked it up and I actually agree with dxo mark that this phone does worse than the phone I used to have in low light photos(s21 ultra snapdragon). Other than that, the capabilities this system  is really good. I do wish they would up the size of the ultrawide some so they can gather more natural detail and have less sharpening on those photos. Maybe a 1/1.7 size sensor. Also, open the aperture a stop or two on the super telephoto. That'll help those shots alot, and make the sensors legit 12mp sensors, not upscaled 10 to 12. They tend to have alot of artifact when zooming into the photos taken with them at times. (i know I know, your not suppose to zoom into a zoomed photo). Video quality across the board with the main sensor is top tier, even in low light. The 50 and 200 mp shots are cool to play with. 50 is a nice middle ground. I do think the 3x should be changed to a 5x because 3x and cropping into a 200mp photo is sort of similar...kind of defeats the purpose of having both. One other addition which would get rid of the need of needing a macro is making the 3x zoom lens being able to focus really close, within like 5 cm's(or is it their 10x that does that?) .... I believe the vivo 90 pro+ does this but can't remember..."
What do you think if Samsung removes the s pen in later ultra models
The only 12GB version is the 1T storage version compared with last years 256g with 12GB . This year the 256g has only 8g.
To be honest it's a very nice phone but if you have an S22 ultra it's not worth upgrading from unless you like to have the latest and greatest. It's not worth giving up a great phone for a slightly better phone because of battery life. I regularly hit between 6-7.5 hrs of SOT which is more than enough for anyone in a single day's use.
S23 ultra best Samsung phone I have had coming from s22 plus massive upgrade new chip set is amazing
1 mth of usage? EXCELLENT! This wld be my daily driver device for afew years to come.
"I'm finally retiring my s9+ after 5 years of service!
Looking forward to receiving my s23 ultra"
"Does cream looks like white after putting up a transparent case? But If I go to green I'll be missing that golden pen tip which stands out with that black pen (pen color is black in all colors but the place where you click and use it, that depends on the color you purchase)
S23 ultra green or beige color I'm confused"
Got my 23 Ultra 1TB in Green unlocked & paid off! Love it!!
Watching on a s23 base. Awesome phone
I wish the fold 5 was getting this camera but sadly it's not. I'm debating on upgrading to S23U from my Fold 2 but it's hard to get rid of the big screen. Although the cameras on the folds is nothing to write home about
Where did you get that wallpaper. Love it
Just got a case for my Zfold4! Now feels complete. . .too small without a case
Finally! Been waiting for your video about this. Great review Qbking
"What’s ridiculous is that these expensive phones are so breakable.  I wouldn’t care if they made the back with plastic, with an area to allow wireless charging."
4nm process... The battery life has been incredible so far coming from Qualcomm 8nm
Thanks for watching my review! I also go into more detail on the new software features in my impressions video: https://youtu.be/iPVbDwD3u2k
Been iPhone user since the first one and I have the 14 pro I purchased the s23 ultraone week ago and WOW I'm blowned away what an amazing piece tech much props to samsung for this
"Reasons to consider buying s23 ultra
1.Better battery life 
2.Insane zoom shots and better 8k video this year
3. Faster processor. Customised 8gen2 designed for Samsung"
"I've had the 23 ultra since it was released, excellent battery life, low light photos are very good, sound from the speakers is noticeably better than the 22 ultra, I've been an S pen user for over 10 years, use it every day ,i wouldn't want to be without it, I'm an electrician, so it's brilliant for keeping notes of jobs I've been on, lighting measurements and drawings, materials lists, bits of paper get lost. As for low life shots , it has to be slower to let more light in,  and obviously you have to keep it still, same with any phone."
"Worst part of this new sensor is low light photography. Paticularly there is too much noise in the photos. I looked it up and I actually agree with dxo mark that this phone does worse than the phone I used to have in low light photos(s21 ultra snapdragon). Other than that, the capabilities this system  is really good. I do wish they would up the size of the ultrawide some so they can gather more natural detail and have less sharpening on those photos. Maybe a 1/1.7 size sensor. Also, open the aperture a stop or two on the super telephoto. That'll help those shots alot, and make the sensors legit 12mp sensors, not upscaled 10 to 12.

Funny how nobody talks about how the edges on the s23 ultra start to warp. Mine and others did the same. S21 ultra way better. Buyer beware on these phones
"I still don't get why ever since One UI was implemented, they got rid of the Ultrawide Distortion Correction feature of the camera?"
Why are none of the reviewers talking about the WiFi 6 issue. This needs more coverage so Samsung fixes it. It's all over the forums but not mentioned in any videos.
"I have this phone for over 2 months.  I don't know if anyone has the same problem that I have.  It keeps turning on and off by itself, and 1 time when I updated  the screen is frozen.  I send it back to Samsung and they reset it to manufacturing and deleted all of my pictures. Very dissapoint it"
So why is it no one mentions the iPhones struggle with low-light pics? You have to hold the phone still for 2 and 3 seconds and it still is average at best. But every one points out Samsung's low light issues... Samsung is the camera king... And they have the best phone on the market.
Problem with a lot of these flagships phones now is that they have matured so much there really isn’t any reason to upgrade.
"Those casetify cases for the S23 U are way overpriced, $72 for a simple case, it's absurd."
"Hey Tim, pls never change the first 3 second intro. It's amazing since day 1."
"Thank you for mentioning how difficult it is to switch phones with esim, iphone to samsung. On att you have to call to switch phones. The industry is not quite ready or set up for easy esim switching it seems."
Is it a big difference between the 8gb of ram ultra to the 12 gb ram one?
You should make a video on the Samsung Galaxy S23 and the Samsung Galaxy S23 plus.
From experience the corners barley dig in to your palm compared to the iPhone chassis. I left the Garden and have no regrets !
That's a great wallpaper on your phone. Where did you get it from.
6:26 so  true  Tim
can it handle 1 hour contious video recording and does it heat
Nice review! Which do you prefer. The S23 Ultra or Xiaomi 13 Pro? Restrictions aside.
Many of my friends have used apple for years and this year I convinced them to get the S23 Ultra and they said they will never go back to apple!
"I´ve heard that samsung phones are good at taking crisp photos of the moon...was it a ""space zoom"" ?"
"One ui needs more animation upgrades. Right now, it's too basic."
What about the speakers compared to the s22 ultra and the iphone 14 pro max??
"Coming from a long time Iphone user (since iphone 7) Just swapped to the S23 Ultra from a 13 Pro Max. I got my device yesterday and I am COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY. Nothing is beyond my reach, If There is something that I don't like guess what? There are applications to change what I don't like. I FINALLY HAVE FREEDOM. This is by far the best phone I've ever owned Its a multi tasking MONSTER. I can finally download stuff from an app in the background and it actually download without being stuck on that single screen. 10/10 for me. I love it so much I went out to Best Buy today and bought a Galaxy Watch 5."
"Best phone I have ever used ! What amazes me the most is the UI smoothness and the battery life! 2 hours of gaming + social media all day and I still have 30 to 40% left at night ! Plus the cameras are just amazing !
If you have the money and aren't locked in Apple's ecosystem, this is the best phone you can buy"
Watching this review on my S23 Ultra! Solid review! I came from an iPhone 12 Pro Max and I haven't looked back
"I've had my 23 ultra since beginning of Feb and it's unreal. I've not had a single issue since I put my sim in. It's efficient, ultra fast and the screen is absolutely beautiful. Love the matte green colour too. I change phones very frequently but for the first time I am 100% happy with a device."
Watching this review on my S23 Ultra. I'm coming from S21 Ultra (exynos version) and I must say that there's really much of an improvement. Battery life and camera performance are excellent.
"This is the best phone of all time! Not going to lie but people looking back 5 years from now will say how complefe this phone was! Also I can arguably say the same for the mate 20 Pro as for me the mate 20 Pro was ahead of its time! Simply incredible to see Samsung making an ultra polished product! Beautiful to hold and beautiful to behold! The cameras are incredible! Seriously thr battery on this is incredible it has never have died on me after 2 months of usage! Got over 800gb left of storage! And it ain't slowed down, gaming is visually amazing, and the one ui 5 is ultra smooth! I won't say this phone is a game changer I would say it's the benchmark for all other phones!"
"Great video! I agree with everything you said,  especially ONEUI! But video I pick the S23U,  yes maybe the iPhone wins by 1 point in Video but that 10x optical zoom at 4k is what gets me! I absolutely love it to record my kids soccer, basketball games, and track races!"
the s23 ultra has been getting a lot of positive feedback! great release by Samsung
30 days with this phone. Oh what an experience. The best mobile experience I've ever had in my life.
Definitely agree with bottom speaker being in wrong place and I am surprised that Samsung didn’t see how holding the phone landscape obscures speaker. The speakers are very good so why not ensure that they were in the correct place during design process.
"This is an excellent review - super slick, super professional, and very well done.  Your pitch and content is excellent and very clear btw.  I dropped my Z Fold3 and now the wifi now doesn't work - along with me peeling the already bubbled and peeling screen protector off the main screen, this apparently voided the warrantee as well.  So if you have a Fold - do not take the screen protector off or it'll void your warrantee.  What can you do!.  Love hate relationship with the Fold - very very vulnerable to drops as the cases you buy are crap, and in the folded position, the screen is tiny - this is where you'll do most of your texting, so don't have big thumbs.  So back to the S range.  This will be my third Galaxy having moved from the grip of Apple.  Never leaving Android.   The S23 Ultra ticks al the boxes.  Love the look of the thing and the big screen.  Looking forward to receiving it.  So thank you again for your excellent review - might nip over to Casetify for a quick look also."
Used to have an android when they were still naming their os with desserts and switched to iPhone because of the smoothness. Recently had an iPhone 13 and decided to give android another try with the s23 ultra and HOLY CRAP I will never go back to iPhone. The software and hardware have improved drastically. So much freedom to do what ever I want. Best phone I've used.
"You can have the phone automatically limit charging to 85% to prolong long term battery life. My S23 Ultra can still be used all day with 20-30% battery left at the end of the day. 

Under Settings, Battery and Device care, Battery, More Battery Settings, Protect Battery."
I've got my S22 Ultra... not a drastic difference to make me want to upgrade to the S23 Ultra. I'm fine with the phone I have now
I am happy to be in the S23 ultra family the pen has moved because the camera takes up a larger area and there is no longer enough space to be on the right side
It is also my favorite phone so far! I just love how it stays longer which is what I need.
"Thanks as always for superb content.  I will make the jump at the beginning of next year as well from my Note 20 Ultra to the S23 Ultra. I just hate to leave the Note series,  but we won't be getting any updates starting January 2024."
Amazing video.. hey saf just wanted to ask does both the speakers work for notifications ? In my s23 ultra only bottom speaker works for notifications . I dont know you noticed o no but yea thats a big problem bcoz the the sound for notification is too low bcoz of that.
I am loving my s23 ultra so far - the only thing I am struggling with is finding a good screen protector! Any recommendations?
I upgraded from the s10 plus and gave my a53 to my mother who needed 5g and the s23 ultra is the best I have owned thus far. Only thing I dislike is removal of micro SD card.   Samsung s23 ultra is better than the iphone 14 pro max and Pixel no comparison and I've used all 3. For those of us who know tech we always knew Samsung was way more fun to use with more capabilities than the iPhone. Trust me the camera is way better than the iPhone and more fun unlimited features.  Now with the pixel I don't prefer the operating system but I respect the pixel camera

"Before S23 Ultra I had LG G7 thinq.
Can't say bad words about galaxy it works for everything I can think of, I fall in love with that spen taking notes is just incredible.
Right now I'm waiting for some super thin kevlar case,  I have a silicon case and don't like it adding that 2-3 mm is too much I prefer using the phone without it."
i still have no clue if i should keep the s23u or the pixel 7 pro ( ordered both the past week and wantedto try them out) what would you personally pick?
"Hey my brother great video as always, I did not do the trade in deal with the S23 ultra me and my wife have the S22 ultra with 512 GB a amazing phone so much storage and your right our phones are much quicker with the 512 GB it helps out alot we download what ever we want with out worry of using all our storage. Saying all that to say there was not much of s difference to change our phones to S23 ultra, plus samsung was not giving much on the trade as they did with S22 ultra I paid $373 for my S22 ultra 512 GB to get the S23 ultra with 512 GB it wasn't worth plus our S22 ultra has great battery life and I think that has to do with the 512 GB  anyway love your channel thanks your friendly neighborhood Doorman william from NYC forgettaboutit"
"Perfect phone! Finally we got rid off the Exynos! Way better battery efficiency! The camera is outstanding! The only complain I really have is that you cannot change the Aperture and I believe that for a flagship phone, we should have this possibility!"
Day 2 with my s23 ultra absolutely love it
Holding my s21 ultra for one more year! Can't wait for the s24
"Good content as usually, however I would appreciate less specification talk, and more sharing of experience after this 2 months of usage :)"
"Ramadan Kareem Supersaf!
Would you do a new Supersaf camera style review with the recent new camera updates. Like a before and after the update and against the Iphone 14 Pro Max to see the improvements? 
Samsung claims significant camera improvements and I am really wondering how significant they really are??"
"Have you checked out the new S23, NOT the Ultra? Wonder if you think it's also worth it. I am still currently using the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and have not liked the ones that have come out for: battery life, camera quality, size, weight. Seems that S23 would be a good replacement for me ????"
"I like the speaker position. Coz even i use the phone in landscape mode like you do, and that makes the sound get reflected from my hands straight to ears, which makes the sound louder and clearer."
"Got the phone at lunch. And really, my favourite thing is the battery life. When I do forget to unplug it and it charges to 100%, the phone will easily last me 1 day and a half. Sometimes, I wake up in the morning, charge it for 20-30 mins before work, and it last me the whole day with a good enough charge remaining."
"Using s23u graphite one, i dont have any problems with it,yes i agree that placement of speaker and spen should be on the right side as most people are right handed but i think it is not possible because we have cameras on that side and spen is very long so its not possible probably anyways great device"
Very happy with this phone. Super smooth and so fast. No complaints.
Best review of Samsung s23 ultra love your content keep it up bro ️
Just got my normal S23 in the mail this week. Super excited to start using it!
"My first apple was iphone 3Gs then i upgrade to 5s then iphone X and i swich to S23 ultra since the first launch, the value for money i got is great, the UI very smooth, battery life, camera are so good i never looked back to apple, best decision not to upgrade to 14 pro"
"If S23 ultra battery life is 10-15% weaket than Iphone 14 pro max, then S23 ultra is better in this category, because charging time is double faster. For me that is more important, I mean charging speed.
Saf talking about 100x zoom, like its not useful, but it is. Not for some crazy good pictures, no, it is because helps in some situation when you need to read something or see something. It is always debate which phone is the best but for me S23 ultra is the best. You have several fantastic flagship choices (Iphone, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Honor and even Huawei) and you can""t choose badly."
"the s pen doesnt make the battery smaller, cause the phone got thhicker and heavier. my note 10+ has a 4300mh battery and is considerably thinner and lighter than the s23ultra. i personally dont use the spen much, so id rather get more battery or in the case of the s23ultra make it thinner."
May I ask whether the photos will be blurred when taking pictures of pets walking? Can setting the shutter speed in the camera assistant app solve the problem of blurry photos?
"I have both the 14 Pro Max and S23 Ultra and Im stunned by how good, fast, efficient and overall great the samsung is. Definitely the best phone out there rn"
